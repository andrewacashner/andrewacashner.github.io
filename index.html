        <h1> Profile </h1>

        <p>
        I am a musician and scholar of music, specializing in devotional music
        of early modern Mexico and Spain.  
        I am an assistant professor of music at the University of Rochester. 
        </p>

        <p>
        I teach courses in the history, structure, and cultural meanings of
        music.
        See the <a href="teaching/index.html">teaching</a> page for course
        descriptions.
        </p>

        <p>
        My research examines how people have used music to express and enact
        their religious beliefs.  
        I am interested in how people across time and in different cultures use
        music to create relationships with each other and with what Olivier
        Messiaen called <q>the world beyond</q>, especially the ways that music
        can delineate and transgress boundaries between sacred and secular
        domains, and between elite and common social strata.
        </p>

        <p>
        My research has been recognized by the 2015 Alfred Einstein Award from
        the American Musicological Society, and by fellowships and grants from
        the American Council of Learned Societies, the Center for European
        Studies at Columbia University, the Center for Latin American Studies
        at the University of Chicago, and the US Department of Education.
        </p>

        <p>
        My current book project is a study of <q>music about music</q> in
        villancicos, a genre of vernacular devotional music from
        seventeenth-century Mexico and Spain.
        These <q>metamusical</q> villancicos&mdash;such as pieces about heavenly
        and angelic music, the harmony of the spheres, and representations of
        human singing and dancing&mdash;reveal how Hispanic Catholics understood
        musicâ€™s power in the relationship between hearing and faith.
        See the <a href="research/index.html">research</a> page for more information.
        </p>

        <p>
        I perform regularly on piano, organ, and harpsichord.
        I enjoy collaboration and improvisation across a broad stylistic range.
        My compositions include choral music, songs, and solo piano pieces.
        See the <a href="performance/index.html">performance</a> page for
        recordings and scores.  
        </p>

        <p>
        I received the PhD from the University of Chicago, with the dissertation
        <q>Faith, Hearing, and the Power of Music in Hispanic Villancicos,
            1660&ndash;1700</q>.  
        I received the Master of Sacred Music degree in organ performance from
        the University of Notre Dame, and a Bachelor of Music in piano
        performance from Lawrence University.
        I also studied piano performance at the New England Conservatory of
        Music.  
        I previously taught at the University of Southern California.  
        See the <a href="cv.html"><em>curriculum vitae</em></a> page for more
        information on my publications and experience.
