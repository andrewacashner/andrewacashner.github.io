        <h1>Profile</h1>
        <p>
        Welcome.
        I am a musician and scholar of music with interests in Native American
        music, Spanish and Latin American music, Christian worship and
        theology, colonial music and global music history, and music and
        computation.  
        I am an assistant professor of music at the University of Rochester,
        and I am active professionally as a pianist, ensemble director, and
        composer.
        </p>
        <p>
        Through my research and teaching I am pursuing a holistic approach to
        understanding how structures of musical sound are linked to structures
        of society.
        I am interested in the ways that people enact their fundamental beliefs
        through music, especially the ways we use song to connect with each
        other and the divine.
        I am also interested in how we use and abuse music as a tool of power.
        I want to find ways to use teaching, research, and performance to undo systems of oppression and build a just society.
        These questions have motivated my research into Christian devotional
        music of the Spanish Empire and the traditional songs and dances of the
        Onöndowa’ga:’ (Seneca) Nation on whose land I live and work.
        </p>
        <p>
        My work has been supported and recognized by the National Endowment for
        the Humanities, the American Council of Learned Societies, the US
        Department of Education, and the American Musicological Society.
