                  This course, as part of a four-semester sequence of courses in the
                  history of Western music for music majors, will give you the opportunity
                  to engage in the close study of practices of music-making from around 1730
                  to 1850.  The course concentrates primarily on notated musical
                  compositions that, starting in this period, came to be regarded by people
                  in the educated upper classes of Europe and the parts of the world
                  colonized by Europeans as a canon of classic masterworks—as the core of
                  what has become known as Classical music.  We will study the history of
                  <q>innovation within tradition</q> as we examine the ways composers
                  established their place in the tradition by extending and transforming
                  earlier models.  The course will provide knowledge, tools, and analytical 
                  perspectives for understanding music by Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven,
                  Schubert, Schumann, Berlioz, Chopin, and Verdi, in genres of opera, solo
                  and chamber instrumental music, symphonies, religious music, and song.
                  This repertoire has become an important aspect of musical life across the
                  globe today, especially in east Asia.  The course will also consider the
                  relationship between this tradition and other kinds of musical practice
                  such as oral traditions of folk music and mass-mediated popular music; and
                  it gives attention to the musical creativity of women, people of color,
                  and disadvantaged groups.

                  We have two primary goals: first, we want to know this music at a detailed
                  level and to understand how composers and musicians changed their
                  techniques and styles across the historical period we are studying.
                  Second, we want to understand the cultural and social context of this
                  music, with the understanding that all music serves a social function and
                  both expresses cultural values.  For this reason we will understand how
                  institutions, patrons, performers, critics, and audiences shaped this
                  music and how the music shaped their lived experience.  We will consider
                  how musical practices were linked to the major intellectual and historical
                  events of the period, especially the Enlightenment, the French Revolution
                  and Napoleonic wars, and the Romantic movement.  In sum, I want you to
                  understand music historically, and understand history musically.

                  The final and most important element of this class is that it is designed
                  to prepare you to make your own decisions about how to tell the story of
                  music, with particular emphasis on the free exchange of ideas in
                  collaboration.  With respect to the departmental course catalog
                  description, this course should help you develop a critical perspective on

                  It is important to know the facts of how history has been told before, but
                  it is more important to use your understanding of the past to shape where
                  the story goes in the future.

                  The course is structured in three units.  We will balance breadth with
                  depth by focusing on three large works, each of which serves as a focal
                  point for one units.  The main class sessions will feature periods of
                  lecture, discussion, group projects, and in-class performance; the
                  workshops with the teaching assistant will reinforce and balance the other
                  sessions with an even greater emphasis on interactive learning and group
                  work.  Each unit will culminate in a roundtable discussion, in which small
                  groups will present the result of their research and discussion in the
                  weekly workshops and the whole class will discuss the most pressing and
                  puzzling questions relevant to that unit.  Through this discussion, and
                  through a quiz afterward on repertoire (via listening) and technical
                  matters, both you and I will be able to assess what the class is learning,
                  and what areas we can improve moving forward.  The workload will require
                  about one hour of reading and at least two hours of listening and score
                  study each week.  You will need to spend additional time outside class on
                  weekly writing assignments, group work, and writing a larger analysis
                  paper (see the <a href="#assignments">list of assignments</a> below).

                  <li>Demonstrate detailed, technical knowledge of musical pieces from the
                     time period and regions covered in this course—with a deeper knowledge
                     of three larger works—and convey your understanding of how these
                     pieces relate to each other historically.

                  <li>Analyze a piece of Classical music in writing, with attention to its
                     style, formal structure, and its range of possible meanings and social
                     functions; convey this analysis in a coherent, persuasive,
                     evidence-based essay.

                  Please check both the Blackboard site and your e-mail every day for
                  announcements from this class.  Make sure you have configured Blackboard
                  to send announcements and site changes to your e-mail address, and make
                  sure you have your university e-mail set up so that you can check it
                  easily.  You may contact me through my e-mail (listed at the beginning of
                  the syllabus), and I will respond as soon as I can during normal business
                  hours.  Be advised that I may not be able to respond to e-mails on
                  evenings, weekends, or holidays until the start of the next business day.

                  Official <strong>office hours</strong> are listed at the beginning of the

                  someone else is already there, just knock or say hello so I know you are
                  waiting and I’ll make sure there is time for you.  I am also available by
                  appointment: e-mail me or ask me after class and we’ll find a time.  I am
                  here to help you and I want the opportunity to get to know you!

                  I will take attendance at every class, and the teaching assistant will
                  take attendance at every workshop.  While there is no grade for attendance
                  and participation, you will learn best if you come to every class and get
                  involved as fully as you can in whatever we are doing in the classroom.
                  That involvement starts before you come to class as you prepare each class
                  session’s listening and reading assignments, as you write in your
                  listening journal, and as you do your other coursework alone and with your
                  classmates.

                  The music and reading for each class is listed on the detailed schedule
                  <em>below</em> the title and date of the class session.  You are expected
                  listen to and read all of the assigned material <em>before</em> you come
                  to class that day.

                  <strong>Workshops</strong> are an important component of the class, in
                  which you have the opportunity to work in smaller groups with the teaching
                  assistant on a variety of tasks and topics.  These are meant to be
                  hands-on learning opportunities to build your skills and give you the
                  chance to get help in learning; as well as allowing us to deal with some
                  topics that don’t fit as well in the format of the rest of the class.

                  Please turn in your work <em>on paper</em> to the bin on my office door,
                  or to the TA if the assignment is due in the workshop.  Use a basic
                  12-point font, double spaced, with one-inch margins on all sides.  Staple
                  the pages together, and make sure they include your name and the name and
                  date of the assignment.  Unless you make arrangements with me in advance,
                  which I must confirm in writing, I will only accept work in hard copy, not
                  via e-mail.

                  Assignments are due on the date listed in the syllabus.  Assignments
                  turned in after that time will be considered late, and a penalty may be
                  deducted from the grade.  Unless you arrange an extension with me in
                  advance, which I must confirm in writing, I will not accept assignments
                  more than a week after the original due date.

                  It is my goal to build a safe, welcoming, and encouraging classroom
                  community for every student, and I invite you to join me in working toward

                        makes a complaint of discrimination or harassment on the basis on a
                        protected status or who provides information or otherwise participates
