          <h3>Hearing Faith: Music as Theology in the Spanish Empire</h3>

          <p>Leiden: Brill, 2020<p>

          <p class="abstract">
          <cite>Hearing Faith</cite> explores the ways Roman Catholics in the
          seventeenth-century Spanish Empire used music to connect faith and
          hearing. From the Royal Chapel in Madrid to Puebla Cathedral in
          colonial Mexico, communities celebrated Christmas and other feasts
          with villancicos, a widespread genre of vernacular poetry and
          devotional music. A large proportion of villancico texts directly
          address the nature of hearing and the power of music to connect people
          to God.  By interpreting complex and fascinating examples of “music
          about music” in the context of contemporary theological writing, the
          book shows how Spanish Catholics embodied their beliefs about music,
          through music itself. Listening closely to these previously
          undiscovered and overlooked archival sources reveals how Spanish
          subjects listened and why.

            <p class="abstract">
            Church ensembles of Spaniards across the Spanish Empire regularly
            impersonated African and other non-Castilian characters in the
            villancicos they performed in the Christmas Matins liturgy.
            Although some scholars and performers still mistakenly assume that
            ethnic villancicos preserve authentic Black or Native voices, and
            others have critiqued them as Spaniards’ racist caricatures, there
            have been few studies of the actual music or of specific local
            contexts. This article analyzes Al establo más dichoso (At the
            happiest stable), an ensaladilla composed by Juan Gutiérrez de
            Padilla for Christmas 1652 at Puebla Cathedral. In this
            performance his ensemble impersonated an array of characters
            coming to Christ’s mangers, including Indian farm laborers and
            African slaves.  The composer uses rhythm to differentiate the
            speech and movement of each group, and at the climax he even has
            the Angolans and the angels sing together—but in different meters.
            Based on the first edition of this music, the article interprets
            this villancico within the social and theological context of
            colonial Puebla and its new cathedral, consecrated in 1649. I
            argue that through this music, members of the Spanish elite
            performed their own vision of a hierarchical and harmonious
            society.  Gutiérrez de Padilla was himself both a priest and a
            slaveholder, and his music elevates its characters in certain ways
            while paradoxically also mocking them and reinforcing their lowly
            status. Building on Paul Ricoeur’s concept of the <q>three worlds of
              the text,</q> the article compares the representations imagined
            within the musical performance with archival evidence for the
            social history of the people represented and the composer’s own
            relationships with them (the world behind the text).  Looking to
            the world projected <q>in front of</q> the text, I argue that these
            caricatured representations both reflected and shaped Spaniards’
            attitudes toward their subjects in ways that actively affected the
            people represented. At the same time, I argue that Spanish
            representations mirrored practices of impersonation among Native
            American and African communities, especially the Christmastide
            Black Kings festivals, pointing to a more complex and
            contradictory vision of colonial society than what we can see from
            the slaveholder’s musical fantasy alone.

            <p class="abstract">
            As part of the festivities of Corpus Christi in 1628, a cathedral
            choir in colonial Mexico sang about the Eucharist through the metaphor
            of a card game.  This music is a previously unstudied, fragmentary
            villancico, composed by Juan Gutiérrez de Padilla for the cathedral of
            Puebla de los Ángeles, and it opens a window into the social history
            of card-playing and gambling in the Spanish colonies.  It stems from a
            broader tradition of <q>divinizing</q> cards, including poetry and
            drama by Lope de Vega and González de Eslava.  The article explores
            the theological and social implications of using liturgical music to
            present Christ as a rogue card player, winning humanity back from the
            devil by laying down the trump card of his own body on the table.
            Includes an edition of the surviving music.  The online version
            includes a recording played on the organ by the author.

          <h2>PhD Dissertation</h2>

          <h3>Faith, Hearing, and the Power of Music in Hispanic Villancicos,
            1600&ndash;1700</h3>

          <p>University of Chicago, 2015 (Advisor: Robert L. Kendrick)</p>

          <p><em>The dissertation is available through ProQuest Dissertations,
            but it is now superseded by my monograph, edition, and additional

          <p class="abstract">
          In seventeenth-century Mexico and Spain, many villancicos (the
          predominant genre of vocal sacred music with vernacular words) used
          music to represent itself, with topics of singing, dancing, and music
          of the spheres.  This study draws on such pieces as sources for
          understanding early modern Catholic beliefs about music.  The central
          question concerns music’s role in the relationship between hearing and
          faith, particularly as used by the Spanish church and state.  In a
          series of case studies, the project traces lineages of “metamusical”
          villancicos on the subject of heavenly music through networks of
          interrelated musicians.  The study balances a global perspective with
          local case studies, with particular focus on Puebla de los Ángeles in
          Mexico and Montserrat, Segovia, and Zaragoza in Spain.

          <h3>The Reception of Paul Gerhardt’s Hymns in the Seventeenth Century</h3>

          <p class="abstract">
          Despite the prominence of the hymns of Paul Gerhardt (1607–1676)
          in the liturgical works of J. S. Bach and in churches today, scholars
          like Irmgard Scheitler and Walter Blankenburg have argued that
          Lutherans in the seventeenth century used new hymns like Gerhardt’s
          only for private devotion, and did not sing them in public liturgies
          until the eighteenth century, under the influence of Pietism.  In
          contrast, Christian Bunners argues that church choirs introduced the
          liturgical use of these hymns before Pietism.  This thesis explores
          the role of Gerhardt’s hymns in Lutheran communities in the three
          spheres of home, school, and church.  It critically examines numerous
          hymnal publications, and presents new evidence from school and church
          manuscript collections and inventories, not considered by the other
          scholars, arguing that Gerhardt’s hymns were not relegated to domestic
          use, but were also sung in church in many places by school choirs and
          perhaps also congregations.
