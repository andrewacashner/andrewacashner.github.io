<h3>
Introduction to Western Art Music, University of Chicago
</h3>

<i>Taught spring quarter 2014</i>

<p>
Students in this course, which fulfills an arts requirement in the undergraduate core curriculum, learn to listen for how people have used musical structures to create meaning and shape experience.
Together the class considers how music might function as an art form, based on select examples from the European and North American tradition generally known as “Classical.”
The course is structured in four units:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Values and Methods
	<ul>
	<li>What might Western art music be, and how might we learn to listen to it in a more detailed and critical way?</li>
	<li><em>Music of Britten, Chopin, Copland, Vaughan Williams</em></li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>Functions of Music: Art in the Service of Faith
	<ul>
	<li>What is the connection between religious contemplation of music (as in Boethius) and modern approaches to music as art?</li>
	<li>What is universal about “art music” and what is culturally specific?</li>
	<li>How can we understand musical art as having a social function within a particular worldview?</li>
	<li><em>Devotional music from chant and Hildegard through Binchois, Machaut, Monteverdi, and J. S. Bach</em></li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>Art Music in the Classical Tradition
	<ul>
	<li>How did the most influential innovators of the Classical tradition establish modern values of musical art?</li>
	<li>How can we recognize innovation within a tradition, and vice versa?</li>
	<li><em>Symphonies and sonatas by Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven; Modernist experiments by Stravinsky and Cage</em></li>
	<li>Final student group projects on Stockhausen, Berio, Philip Glass, Meredith Monk, Chen Yi, John Zorn </li>
	</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<h3>
Music in Western Civilization II, 1750–present, University of Chicago
</h3>

<i>Taught spring quarter 2013</i>

<p>
This course, which fulfills a “civilization” requirement in the undergraduate social-sciences core curriculum, traces the changing functions of music in Western society from G. F. Handel to J. Bieber. 
The course focuses on sociological, economic, and political aspects of music-making in a wide range of music, including jazz and popular music.
Students learn to apply a set of “social elements of music”—to complement the traditional “elements of music,” which only consider the sonic aspects of music—to analyze music’s social functions, whether in the nineteenth-century opera house and concert hall, or in contemporary “communities of sentiment” (to use Arjun Appadurai’s term) across the globe.
