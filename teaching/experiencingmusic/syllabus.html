<h1>Meetings and Format (Revised 2020/09/24)</h1>
<p>This class will be completely online and asynchronous.</p>
<p>Each week I will ask you to write a listening/learning journal entry in which you respond to the course materials and discussions from the previous week and discuss the materials assigned for the coming week. I am especially interested to see the questions you have, from basic informational questions to critical and philosophical ones.</p>
<p>Each week I will post one or two teaching videos. I will respond to what you have been writing in your journals and present new concepts for the coming week.</p>
<p>Optional discussion groups are available through Blackboard and I encourage you to join one so that you can support each other and talk through the themes of the course.</p>
<p>You will be assigned to a small group with whom you will prepare a group presentation.</p>
<p>I will also be available for regular office hours via Zoom, and other times by appointment.</p>

<!-- {{{1 DESCRIPTION -->
</section>
<section id="course-description" class="level1">
<h1>Course Description</h1>
<p>According to the course catalog, this is “a ‘music appreciation’ course that celebrates the ‘ears-on’ experience of various aspects of musical performance. Participants develop listening skills through live musical presentations, in-class performances, discussions with the performers and living composers, and guided listening sessions.”</p>
<p>This course introduces you to music as a discipline for understanding human experience. It considers both how people <em>do</em> music and how we talk and think about music (in other words the course is introductory both to music and to musicology).</p>
<p>Its goal is to equip you to think critically about the experience of music and to empower you to engage with music in a way that will not only enrich your life in a lasting way but also allow you to make a positive impact in society. We will break down the complex whole of musical experience into different elements of how the music sounds and how the music functions socially, so that you can understand how those elements interact to make music mean something to people. These elements are as follows:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th style="text-align: left;">SONIC</th>
<th style="text-align: left;">SOCIAL</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;">Rhythm</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Performer</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: left;">Melody</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Composer</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;">Harmony</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Audience</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: left;">Texture</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Patron</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;">Color</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Venue/Medium</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: left;">Genre</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Canon</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>We will learn to identify and analyze these elements in a select body of interesting and useful examples, and in a broader exploration of musical practices and repertoire. We will listen to a wide variety of music from multiple global traditions.</p>
<p>We will focus on three primary themes in the units of the course:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Genre</strong> as an intersection point for the sonic and social elements of music; with nocturnes and piano rags as case studies</li>
<li><strong>Canon</strong>, a socially constructed system of value and power, and a tradition of creativity within historical constraints, that is, “innovation within tradition”; with choral music traditions as case studies</li>
<li><strong>Voices</strong>, the ways we use music to create individual and group identities; with case studies of well-known music creators including Beyoncé, Kendrick Lamar, and Yo-Yo Ma.</li>
</ol>
<p>The course is <em>not</em> designed to tell you what value you should place on any particular music. It is a fundamental value of this course, as it should be of our whole department, that all music of the world has equal value because all of the people who make and enjoy music in the world have equal value.</p>
<section id="anti-racist-goals" class="level2">
<h2>Anti-Racist Goals</h2>
<p>The teaching of music in this university, like most others, has traditionally emphasized almost exclusively the work of European and white North American men, cultivated by the upper classes of the most powerful societies at the height of colonialism. It has also traditionally ignored or silenced any discussion of that fact. Doing so has resulted in a false, whitewashed history and the promotion of the value system and ideology of white supremacy. Moreover, this institution and others like it have historically discriminated against women and non-white people, and continues to do so in both overt and hidden or even unconscious ways. We have a moral obligation to work against racist structures, policies, and attitudes in our academic disciplines as researchers, in our classrooms as teachers, and in our university as faculty members.</p>
<p>In my research and teaching I am committed to the work of presenting an accurate history of music as a human activity, that gives due respect and attention to the music-making of people across social stations and in everyday life. We cannot understand, for example, the “art music” of the elite without understanding its intimate relationship with more popular and traditional forms of music-making. We must actively work to give more attention to the music of women, ethnic minorities, historically disadvantaged peoples, people of lower economic status, and people outside Europe and North America—including not just as composers but as performers, patrons, and listeners. Educators like me must work harder to make sure that we give the musical creativity of Black people, Indigenous people, and people of color the central position in our histories and theories of music that it deserves.</p>
<p>My own training was, unfortunately, narrowly Eurocentric, and I have been working over many years to try to expand my horizons and appreciation of a broader world of music, and to sharpen my critical understanding of the power dynamics that created the white-dominated worldview in which I was raised. But I recognize I have a long way to go, and I ask for your help in identifying ways that I and my colleagues can improve our anti-racist efforts. <!-- }}}1 --></p>
