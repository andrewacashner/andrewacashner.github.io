<h1 id="changes-of-style">Changes of style</h1>
<h2 id="palestrina-basic-elementsingredients-of-style">Palestrina: Basic elements/ingredients of style</h2>
<ul>
<li>all voices same words, different times</li>
<li>voices follow same melodic pattern with variations
<ul>
<li><strong>imitative counterpoint</strong> – polyphony
<ul>
<li>fugue is a stricter version of this technique</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>structure: <strong>points of imitation</strong> – new melody in imitation for each phrase</li>
<li>strict control of consonance and dissonance
<ul>
<li>all strong beats are perfect (8s, 5s) or imperfect consonances (6s, 3s); cadences 8/5/3, 8/5 triads</li>
<li>dissonances are always prepared by step, and resolve down by step</li>
</ul></li>
<li>duple meter, alla breve time – common for Latin-texted liturgical music</li>
<li>rhythm? opening: breve, semibreve, sb, minim, mn dotted, semiminim
<ul>
<li>connected to idea, feeling of the words</li>
<li>words: Psalm 42: “As the deer pants/longs after streams of water, so my soul longs for you, O Lord”</li>
</ul></li>
<li>word painting (“madrigalisms”)
<ul>
<li><strong>text projection</strong> - making the words clear</li>
<li><strong>text depiction</strong> - painting/illustrating, symbolism, representation</li>
<li><strong>text expression</strong> - style, genre, conventions that bring out the feeling, amplify the experience of the text</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="in-sum">In sum</h3>
<ul>
<li>This <strong>motet</strong> is the paradigm of a style later known as <em>stile antico</em> (Old style), or <em>stylus ecclesiasticus</em> (church style)</li>
<li>Palestrina’s music (along with similar music by Francisco Guerrero, Orlando di Lasso, and others) was widely performed through the 18th century and served as a paradigm (model, standard) of the old-fashioned, traditional way of making music</li>
<li>Examples:
<ul>
<li>J. S. Bach regularly had his choir perform Palestrina in 18th-century Leipzig</li>
<li>This style is the basis of Johann Joseph Fux, <em>Gradus ad parnassum</em> (18C counterpoint treatise)
<ul>
<li>used by Haydn, Mozart; Salieri used it to teach Schubert and Liszt;</li>
<li>Nadia Boulanger used principles derived from it to teach Aaron Copland, Virgil Thomson, Quincy Jones, many others in 20th cent.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>European missionaries saw this style as proof of their cultural superiority, similar to one-point perspective in visual art; they describe other cultures’ music as “all on one note” (like 2D instead of 3D)</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="aspects-of-old-world-worldview">Aspects of “old world” worldview</h1>
<ul>
<li>earth-centered cosmos</li>
<li>church as center and source of knowledge</li>
<li>hierarchy (church, nobility) as God-given order</li>
<li>harmony between the lowly and heavenly, between mundane and otherworldly
<ul>
<li><strong>Neoplatonism</strong>: earthly things are imperfect reflections of heavenly ideals</li>
<li><span class="math inline">2 : 1</span> octave, <span class="math inline">3 : 2</span> fifth, <span class="math inline">4 : 3</span> fourth, <span class="math inline">5 : 4</span> major third</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="changing-elements-moving-into-17th-century">Changing elements moving into 17th century</h1>
<ul>
<li>new, Humanistic approach to text: representing and expressing human feelings</li>
<li>emphasis on realism, even breaking the traditional rules for expression</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="vicente-lusitano">Vicente Lusitano</h2>
<ul>
<li>Black Portuguese composer, theorist</li>
<li>chromatic composition, daring, bold expression</li>
<li><strong>using dissonance for expressive purposes</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="claudio-monteverdi">Claudio Monteverdi</h2>
<ul>
<li>debate with Artusi over madrigal “Cruda Amarylli” for breaking counterpoint rules</li>
<li>brother Guilio Cesare Monteverdi defends him by saying those rules describe the <em>prima prattica</em> (first practice), the traditional style; but they are following a new approach, a <em>seconda prattica</em> initiated earlier by composers like Rore, Willaert, and Gesualdo</li>
<li>“The words are the mistress (the noble lady in charge) of the music, not the servant.”</li>
<li>also says that he is just writing down things that they were already doing in practice (tension between oral and written traditions, and a reminder that we need to look at more than just the score)</li>
