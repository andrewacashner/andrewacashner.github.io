<h1 id="historiography-how-we-write-history">Historiography (How we write history)</h1>
<ul>
<li>thinking historically about music, thinking musically about history</li>
<li><p>what do we gain from focusing on notated musical sources? what do we lose?</p>
<ul>
<li>Gain
<ul>
<li>access to musical sound mediated by notation vs. description</li>
<li>more highly specified than verbal description</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Loss
<ul>
<li>oral traditions</li>
<li>performance practice</li>
<li>distorted view of “what actually happened”</li>
<li>staging, costuming, venue, how the audience responded</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Impact: omitting whole people groups, traditions</li>
</ul></li>
<li>alternate sources of information?
<ul>
<li>ask people! living traditions (which are contemporary)
<ul>
<li>what’s the relationship between tradition and history?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>But there <em>is</em> a lot of notated music to work with still and it is worth doing so as long as we keep these concerns in mind!</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="terminology-periodization">Terminology, Periodization</h2>
<ul>
<li>Where did we get these terms? Medieval, Renaissance, Baroque, Classic, Romantic, Modern
<ul>
<li>First time “romantic” is used for music it’s describing Mozart, so calling Mozart “classical” <em>as opposed to</em> Romantic really doesn’t make much sense!
<ul>
<li>ETA Hoffmann, “Beethoven’s Instrumental Music,” first use of <em>Romantik</em> for music – about Mozart, Haydn</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Guido Adler, founder of <em>Musikwissenschaft</em> (musicology) in Vienna c. 1890
<ul>
<li>Time of intense rivalry among the European imperial powers, nationalism, vying for cultural supremacy within a general idea of white racial superiority
<ul>
<li>Example: the competition between Germans and Austrians to publish early musical sources
<ul>
<li>Germans: <em>Denkmäler der deutschen Tonkunst</em> (monuments of German musical art)</li>
<li>Austrians : <em>Denkmäler der Tonkunst in Österreich</em> (monuments of musical art in Austria)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Following the “hard-sciences” model of geology, biology</li>
<li>Positivism – deduce natural laws from observation of (fossil) evidence</li>
<li><em>Stilgeschichte</em>: style history, style periods like geological layers
<ul>
<li>Medieval</li>
<li>Renaissance</li>
<li><em>Barock</em></li>
<li><em>Wiener Klassik</em> (Viennese Classic) – golden age</li>
<li><em>Romantik</em></li>
<li>Modern</li>
</ul></li>
<li>in which <em>Wiener Klassik</em> is really the first category, starting with assumption by Viennese scholars that the “classics” of their music was the culmination of all music history</li>
<li>tracing rise and fall and this tradition</li>
<li>Cf. music theorist Heinrich Schenker, who explicitly set out to prove the superiority of “classic” music by German geniuses, especially Beethoven, over all other music, especially modern experimental music (like Strauss, Reger, Schoenberg)
<ul>
<li>designed a theoretical system that still works very effectively to make Beethoven appear to be the best of all composers, because it was built to do so</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="musical-theater-early-opera-in-17c-italy">Musical Theater, Early Opera in 17C Italy</h1>
<ul>
<li>Grew out of experiments by noblemen (wealthy landowners) in Renaissance Florence and other cities who gathered to investigate scientific questions and explore Classical (Greek, Roman) literature</li>
<li>In Florence, included Vincenzo Galilei (father of Galileo Galilei, whose experiments drew on his musical training)</li>
<li>Interest in occult (hidden) influences – e.g., sympathetic vibration, affects (human feelings moved by music as well as by stars, planets)</li>
<li>Interest in reviving Greek tragedy, which they believed was fully sung; in absence of surviving music they made up their own idea</li>
<li><p>Experiments with improvising sung poetry with chordal accompaniment (e.g., lute)</p></li>
<li><p>Orfeo/Orpheus – foundational myth of the power of music</p></li>
<li>Precursors: masques, feasts, entremets, intermezzi – lavish court entertainments with drama, music, spectacle</li>
<li><p>Early operas called <em>dramma per musica</em></p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="monteverdi-lorfeo-tu-se-morta">Monteverdi, <em>L’Orfeo</em>: “Tu se’ morta”</h2>
<ul>
<li>Looking at text projection, depiction, expression</li>
<li>Breaking traditional rules for expressive purposes</li>
<li>Modeling musical gestures and patterns on Classical rhetorical devices like <em>anaphora</em> (literally, lifting up: repeating something at a higher pitch level for emphasis)</li>
</ul>
