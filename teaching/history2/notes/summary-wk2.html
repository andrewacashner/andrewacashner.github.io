<h1 id="between-worlds-in-seventeenth-century-europe">Between Worlds in Seventeenth-Century Europe</h1>
<p>The seventeenth century was a time of transition for people in Europe between one relatively stable system of thought that was starting to crumble and a new system that was slowly taking shape. All of this is over-generalizing, of course, but up through the early seventeenth century most European people held a medieval worldview based on an earth-centered cosmos, the Church as the source of all truth, and a hierarchical system of government and feudal system of economics, all understood to be God-given and eternal. Change moved at a different pace in different places (it was faster in England and much slower in Spain, for example), but still steadily over the course of the seventeenth century, new scientific discoveries were challenging people’s view of the cosmos. The reformations and upheavals in Western Christianity undermined the Roman Church’s authority and, together with the rediscovery and revival of Classical Greek and Roman philosophy, led some people to begin to question religious faith altogether (though by and large this was still a very religious age).</p>
<p>As Europeans exploited and colonized the peoples of what to them were newly discovered regions in America, Africa, and Asia, they took what had been a fairly passive understanding of social hierarchy (things had always been this way) and turned it into something they actively built, on land they stole from indigenous people and with labor they extracted by force from enslaved Africans and others. This meant that the colonial powers were in the business of trying to build new worlds (what is now Mexico was called “New Spain”, eastern Canada was “New France”) that were like exaggerated caricatures of the Old World, even more hierarchical, church-centered, and based on the old knowledge; while at the same time the foundations of that old world were crumbling all around them, and the hypocrisy of displacing and enslaving other human beings was turning the whole system into a bitter joke which no one could acknowledge.</p>
<p>The colonial system and the global trade network of the colonial empires set in motion many of the trends that led to the world we call modern because it is the one we have inherited in our own time. The revolutions of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, more scientific discoveries (Newton, much later Darwin), more technological improvements designed to make work on the plantations more efficient, and the broader Industrial Revolution, would in subsequent centuries thoroughly transform the patterns of life not only of Europeans but of people all over the world they had colonized.</p>
<p>The early seventeenth century, then, was a time “between worlds” in many different senses. European people and their colonial subjects balanced contradictory worldviews and systems of thought and social structure in complex and confusing ways. If they seem confusing to us, how much more confusing must they have been to people who lived then and did not have the perspective we do on where they had come from and where they would end up going!</p>
<h1 id="old-and-new-musical-worlds">Old and New Musical Worlds</h1>
<p>Musically we see this tension in many different ways. One simple manifestation is the coexistence of different styles and techniques of music. One thing Catholic, Lutheran, and Anglican churches had in common was that their musicians cultivated a combination of Gregorian chant, Latin-texted polyphony, and new types of of music in vernacular languages such as devotional singing by congregations or choirs (Lutheran hymns, Italian <em>laude</em>, Spanish <em>villancicos</em>). As late as the mid eighteenth-century, J. S. Bach was teaching his choir to sing Palestrina in Lutheran Leipzig and Esteban Salas was teaching his choir to sing chant in Catholic Cuba, while both were also composing elaborate music in the new styles of their era and the developing technique of tonal harmony.</p>
<p>Outside church, composers like Claudio Monteverdi were developing completely new genres of musical performance—monody and <em>dramma per musica</em> (opera)—but these, too, had roots in earlier traditions like musical-dramatic celebrations at noble courts (<em>intermezzi</em> in Italy, <em>entrêmets</em> in France, masques in England) and actually involved a variety of styles and approaches. The new technique of figured bass, and solo singing with <em>basso continuo</em>, resulted from traditions of, on the one hand, improvising sung poetry over chordal accompaniments, like in the societies of aristoctratic amateurs in Florence and elsewhere, and on the other hand, practices of taking polyphonic music and either “reducing” it—for example singing the soprano line, playing the bass line, and filling in the other vocal lines on the keyboard—or “expanding” it, as in practices of <em>intabulation</em> where keyboardists or lutenists (or vihuelists in Spain) would take just the bass line of a motet and improvise their own evocation of the motet over that bass line. The new musical dramas highlighted the technique of <em>recitative</em>, in which a singer could <em>cantar parlando</em> (sing while speaking) or <em>parlar cantando</em> (speak through singing)—in other words, a musically heightened form of dramatic speech using music’s power to move the affections (emotions) to intensify the power of spoken words.</p>
<p>They also grew out of attempts to rediscover the lost power of ancient Greek music, with the belief that Greek tragedies had been fully sung; but also out of attempts to find new and better ways of expressing the meaning and emotion of poetry through music. As Giulio Cesare Monteverdi wrote in his pamphlet war with the conservative critic Artusi, his brother Claudio respected the old way of composing like that of Palestrina, with its strict rules for consonance and dissonance and its rigorous contrapuntal techniques, but that was just the <em>prima prattica</em>, the first practice; but a new, <em>seconda prattica</em> had been developed by sixteenth-century composers like Cipriano da Rore, Adrian Willaert, and Carlo Gesualdo, in which the words commanded the music what to do rather than the reverse. “Poetry” (a female word in Italian) would be the mistress (noble lady in charge) of the music, not the servant. Monteverdi felt free to break traditional rules for the sake of drama, communication, and rhetorical impact. He especially used creative and unorthodox dissonances for expressive purposes.</p>
<p>Over the course of eight books of madrigals, he had progressed from writing in a style similar to Rore to increasingly daring and modern approaches. <em>Cruda amarilli</em> was in the fifth book, which Artusi attacked for a single, not even especially striking, unruly dissonance. By the eigth book, Monteverdi had thrown out the traditional script completely had was trying out things like a full dramatic scene with recitative, instrumental interludes, and evocations of battle through music in the <em>Combattimento di Tancredi e Florinda</em>, based on an epic poem by Tasso that all the learned gentlemen of Italy were reading at the time.</p>
<p>Monteverdi was far from the only innovator in finding new and more expressive ways to sing poetry using monody. Giulio Caccini, one of the composers of the first fully sung opera (about whom more below), published <em>Il nuove musiche</em> (The New Music) in 1602. It is a collection of monodies meant to display the techniques he describes in the book’s famous preface. There he explains his techniques for bringing out poetic meaning and structure through music, borrowing from Classical rhetoric (the art of speechmaking, public speaking, as taught by Quintilian and Cicero from the ancient world) to develop musical equivalents of the tricks orators would use to seize their audience’s attention, drive home a point, make a bold contrast, or build to a climax.</p>
<p>Guilio’s daughter Francesca was also a talented composer, in fact the first woman to compose an opera (<em>La liberazione di Ruggiero</em> in 1625). She also published collections of highly expressive and sensitive monodies. Another composer of monodies, Barbara Strozzi was a virtuosic singer renowned throughout Europe, and published eight volumes of music—possibly the largest printed output of any early seventeenth-century composer.</p>
<h2 id="the-first-operas-italian-court-opera-monteverdi">The First Operas: Italian Court Opera (Monteverdi)</h2>
<p>The first fully sung opera was a production of the story of Orpheus and Eurydice—a Greek myth, transmitted to early modern Europeans primarily through the Latin poetry of Ovid’s <em>Metamorphoses</em>, fundamentally about the power of music even over life and death, but also about the dangers of letting emotion rule over reason. Two composers, Jacobo Peri and Giulio Caccini, composed music to a libretto by Ottavio Rinuccini, which was performed in Florence in October 1600, a fitting start to our century. Both composers wanted the credit for having invented this new type of music and so both men raced to compose music for the parts the other man had composed and both published what they claimed was their own, complete composition.</p>
<p>Seven years later Claudio Monteverdi beat both of them by actually writing a coherent, complete <em>dramma per musica</em>, <em>L’Orfeo</em>, which was performed during Carnival season in Mantua. Like the others this was what we call a “private” or “court opera,” contrasted with the later public, commercial operas cultivated first in Venice. These were lavish, one-off displays of wealth to invitation-only audiences at aristocratic or royal residences, often with quite lofty philosophical and artistic ideals. Operas like this were cultivated at courts across Italy, including at the papal court in Rome, where Alessandro Landi wrote a series of “sacred operas” like <em>Il Sant’Alessio</em>.</p>
<p>Back to Monteverdi’s Orpheus opera: it begins with an impressive instrumental prelude for what at the time was a large orchestra including plucked and bowed strings, organ, and brass instruments. The character <em>Musica</em> introduces herself at the beginning and proclaims her power to move the hearts of listeners, to “melt even the most frozen minds”—a concept Monteverdi illustrates through clever symbolic and rhetorical musical devices. For example, on the word “I can” (or I have the power), the singer moves off the chord in the accompaniment, which seems to force the players to change their harmony, following her bidding. When she speaks of stirring up feelings of “wrath,” she uses quickly moving notes (like the internal movements of angry feelings) over a major triad—major thirds were considered harsher than the soft (<em>mollis</em>) minor thirds in the very early seventeenth century. To depict the frozen hearts, she stays on a single note while the accompaniment moves, creating unexplainable dissonances until she finally creates a resolution in the final cadence.</p>
<p>The beginning of the show manifests its legacy in previous kinds of court entertainments, which were often for weddings, as it stages wedding festivities for Orfeo and Eurydice with lots of festive choral singing and dancing with lively music, likely indebted to traditional dance music. But when a messenger comes with the “bitter” news that Eurydice has died of a poisonous snake bite, Orfeo responds with the accompanied recitative starting “Tu se’ morta” (You are dead), in which Monteverdi uses all the means available to him—abrupt shifts of harmony, symbolic uses of major and minor triads, strange intervals, unorthodox dissonances—to express Orpheus’s grief and his resolve to go even into the depths of the underworld to win Eurydice back. We looked in detail at how Monteverdi both projects the text here and conveys its meaning through techniques both symbolic (depiction) and more directly moving to listeners (expression). Leaping down into a forbidden major seventh above the bass, for example, conveys Orfeo’s feelings about the wrongness of Eurydice’s death: he is singing about a situation that should not exist, in the shock of grief, so it makes sense that the voice would seem to be in a different reality than the accompaniment. Monteverdi creates a clear contrast between the idea “you are dead” and the contrasting “but I am still breathing” through musical patterns that effectively match the rhetorical structure of the text; likewise when he repeats the same ideas, but amplified at a higher pitch level for the second phrase (this should probably be called <em>anaphora</em>). When Orfeo sings about going down to the “deepest abyss” the singer goes down by thirds to the bottom of his range; later when he bids adieu to the sky (or heaven), he leaps back up to the top as if looking to the sky.</p>
<p>The climactic moment in the opera for demonstrating the power of music is when Orfeo uses the song <em>Possente spirto</em> to charm Charon, the gatekeeper of the underworld, into allowing him to enter, through virtuosic, melismatic singing. In the end, though, after the God of the Dead has released Eurydice to return to life with Orfeo, provided he does not look back at her until they are out of the underworld, Orfeo gives into his passions and turns back, thus losing her forever. So despite all the images of music’s power over the affections, Orfeo is a tragic hero, undone by being unable to control his own passions, so that there is in the end a caution for listeners to be wary of that power of music, and keep reason in charge over feeling. That expresses a very common tension in the seventeenth century between indulging in sensory experience and wanting to control it or mitigate its dangers, and is one more sign of the contradictory elements of being between worlds in this period—for which the image of Orpheus literally travelling between worlds can serve as a fitting symbol.</p>
<h2 id="public-commercial-operas-in-venice-cavalli">Public, Commercial Operas in Venice (Cavalli)</h2>
<p>The Teatro San Cassiano opened in Venice in 1637 and completely changed the possibilities for opera as a genre in terms of both artistic goals and economic and social function. Where previously musical dramas were deliberately expensive displays for private audiences, the investors behind this new venture in Venice wanted to produce regular productions of entertainment for a public audience of paying customers. In Venice, at this opera house and others that sprang up quickly after, opera then became a public diversion, accessible to a much wider range of people of different social strata and answerable to their tastes. Theater producers had to develop conventions so that audiences knew what to expect and were pleased either when their expectations were fulfilled or when they were pleasantly surprised. It was not just the economic and social impact of ticket sales and applause that shaped the new approach to opera in Venice—less concerned with lofty humanist ideals, more concerned with provoking laughter (often bawdy), wonder, and delight. It was also the very different character of this city compared to the north Italian cities, or the papal court in Rome, where opera was previously cultivated.</p>
<p>At this time the whole city of Venice was under an interdict from the pope because its bishops were unruly; so essentially the entire city was excommunicated, and this led to a “what happens in Venice, stays in Venice” type of atmosphere. That feeling was strongest in the traditional Carnival season, the period between Christmas and Lent (basically late January to early March, depending on the variable date of Easter) when people celebrated with raucous, topsy-turvy social customs that emphasized social inversion and deviation from the kinds of ascetic strictures that would soon be imposed during Lent, as they still do in Venice, Rio de Janeiro, and New Orleans. Venetian operas featured lots of sexual innuendo with cross-dressing and homoerotic overtones; silly clowns and stuttering hunchbacks; witches and sorcerers. Stock character types recurred in show after show because they were popular and because each opera house had its own company who performed in all the shows, so that audiences came to expect a certain kind of performance from certain singers, regardless of the specific story or theme.</p>
<p>The role played today by Hollywood or Broadway producers was played then by <em>impresarios</em>, who were responsible for hiring the cast, set designer, costumer, librettist, and composer—in roughly that order of importance. The composer was the last person called in, usually after every other element had already been determined—the story, characters, singers and voice types, size of the orchestra. Venetian commercial operas were not, then, high minded dramas that celebrated the subtleties of music’s power to convey the nuances of poetry. The music was much more functional and served to highlight the strengths of the singers, move the story along, and keep the crowd entertained.</p>
<p>That did not mean holding their attention, necessarily. The opera houses survived, as they do now, by selling subscriptions to box seats to wealthy patrons, who thus purchased a semi-private space in which they could see the opera and be seen at the same time, or draw the curtain and play games, eat, fool around with a mistress, and just generally enjoy themselves. If there was a well-known singer doing something impressive or lovely on stage, they would certainly peer over their balconies and check it out, like you would at a baseball game today. But these were not generally musical connoisseurs. Below the box seats was an open area for less well-off people who could only afford a single ticket. Generally they stood or milled about. These buildings did not have restrooms, so men relieved themselves in the corners, or wherever, and women often had to leave and walk a considerable distance to take care of their needs. These were rowdy, smelly spaces. People did not listen politely. They clapped, shouted, booed, hissed at the stage; or they chatted, shot dice, and hung out with friends. Vendors sold food and drink in the house and the atmosphere generally was lively, loud, and not at all like a modern opera house.</p>
<p>No wonder then that these operas can seem so odd to us outside of that context: we might be entertained by the strange mixture of absurd and bawdy humor (which may or may not still seem funny), musical display, and special effects (ocean waves, people flying up or descending down from heaven, people changing into animals; but we might also be bored by the length and lack of musical variety of some of these works, which really were not meant to be listened to closely with primary attention on the music.</p>
<p>Francesco Cavalli was the most successful of Venetian opera composers, and his works were performed all over Europe. His dramatization of the story of Jason and the Argonauts, <em>Il Giasone</em>, was one of the most widely performed of any operas in the mid seventeenth century. <em>La Calisto</em> from 1651 is also based on Greek mythology, and is typical of Cavalli’s works. A couple of characteristic features are the instrumental prologue by the band of strings and continuo, and the blend of recitatives (continuing the earlier operatic tradition) with the new addition of <em>arias</em> or songs. These were typically moments for soloists to show off, and moments when the plot paused for a character to express emotion, as in classic Broadway musicals. They are often in triple meter and the catchy tunes had more clearly delineated melodic phrases and repeating structures compared with recitative. Cavalli and other composers of his day developed different convention types of arias that were familiar to audiences, including the trumpet aria (with a trumpet solo), the lament (often with a repeating descending bass-line pattern), the sorcerer’s incantation scene, and the love duet.</p>
<h1 id="seventeenth-century-music-theory">Seventeenth-Century Music Theory</h1>
<p>Like everything else, theories and practices of music composition were in a chaotic state of transition in the seventeenth century. Musicians continued to train their students using a combination of traditional systems and rules, primarily from sixteenth-century polyphonic music (Catholic, and Lutheran, church musicians also had to learn all the rules for Gregorian chant sufficient to run the liturgies), and learning by imitating contemporary music which may or may not have had any real connection to those rules. By the 1680s many musicians, especially in Italy and France (Corelli, Lully), were writing in what we can recognize as functional tonality with major and minor keys, sequences and modulations, and a structural emphasis on the tension between tonic and dominant chords and key areas. But in the first part of the century, and continuing into the eighteenth in more conservative regions like the Spanish Empire (which, keep in mind, included a huge amount of the globe), the landscape was more varied and can be complex to understand. Nevertheless, we can build a working toolbox of theoretical concepts and analytical techniques that make this music intelligible in something like the way its creators and audiences understood it.</p>
<h2 id="solmization-modes-transpositions">Solmization, modes, transpositions</h2>
<p>The big music treatises of the 16th and 17th century typically begin with plainchant and then move on to polyphony, as these were the types of music church musicians needed to be able to perform and teach, and church music jobs were the most plentiful and stable ones available. The most influential texts were by Zarlino (Italian), Cerone and Lorente (Spanish), Mersenne (French), Praetorius (German), and Kircher (Latin). You should have already learned the basics of chant in another course, but it will be helpful to review Guidonian solmization because musicians still used it.</p>
<p>In the 11th century Guido of Arezzo invented a number of systems we still use today, with the practical goal of making it easier to teach monks to sing Gregorian chant. These were the staff, clefs, solmization, and the Guidonian hand showing all the available notes.</p>
<h3 id="solmization">Solmization</h3>
<p>The basic idea was that most chants had around six notes, and Guido created three hexachords (six-note scales) with which you could sing every chant.</p>
<p>The natural hexachord (<em>naturalis</em>) started on C:</p>
<pre><code>ut re mi fa sol la
C  D  E  F  G   A</code></pre>
<p>The hard hexachord (<em>durus</em>) started on G:</p>
<pre><code>ut re mi fa sol la
G  A  B  C  D   E</code></pre>
<p>There were two kinds of B: hard and soft, notated respectively with a square shape and a round shape on the bottom. The hard B was our B natural, and the square-B symbol is where we got the natural sign from. The soft B was our B flat, and the round-B symbol gave us our flat symbol. So the G hexachord was hard because it featured B natural. It was so called because it used the “hard b” (what we call B natural, notated with a square B symbol that gave us our natural symbol), as opposed to the “soft b,” notated with a round b symbol that gave us our flat symbol.</p>
<p>The last one was the soft hexachord, starting on F and featuring the soft B (B flat):</p>
<pre><code>ut re mi fa sol la
F  G  A  Bb C   D</code></pre>
<p>To sing melodies with more than six notes, you would “mutate” between hexachords, for example shifting from A as <em>la</em> in the natural (C) hexachord to A as <em>re</em> in the hard (G) hexachord.</p>
<p>In all three hexachords the pattern of tones and semitones is the same, with one semitone between <em>mi</em> and <em>fa</em>. If you needed to put a semitone somewhere else, you could create one by <em>musica ficta</em> (false music): by adding a sharp or flat you could create a <em>mi</em>–<em>fa</em> where there would not be otherwise. In later polyphonic music, singers learned to recognize patterns where they would need to “falsify” the music in this way. For example the pattern G–F–G at the end of a piece that ended on G, would likely become G–F#–G (ficta <em>fa</em>–<em>mi</em>–<em>fa</em>). The pattern D–E–D would often become D–Eb–D because of the rule <em>una nota super la semper est canendum fa</em> (one note above <em>la</em> is always to be sung as <em>fa</em>)—in other words, it should be flatted.</p>
<h3 id="modes-in-monophony">Modes in monophony</h3>
<p>Modes developed as a way of classifying Gregorian chants, primarily to make it easier to match up antiphons and psalm tones. They described the basic range or <em>ambitus</em> of the melody and the last note or <em>final</em>. (You may have learned about reciting tones, but that won’t matter for our purposes.) The ambitus could be either <em>authentic</em>, meaning it ranged from the final to an octave above; or <em>plagal</em>, meaning it ranged from the fourth below the final to the fifth above. The modes were in pairs, authentic then plagal, and they started on D. Some writers gave these modes names they had found in Greek theory treatises, even though they actually had nothing to do with what these terms meant in ancient Greece.</p>
<p>In medieval theory there were eight modes, with authentic and plagal modes on D, E, F, and G. Later four more were added, authentic and plagal modes on A and C. They were numbered in order, and most sources use the following numbering (though there were numerous other systems out there, including different systems invented by the same theorists):</p>

<p>All you really need to know is that mode I is on D and that the authentic modes ascend by the odd numbers (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11) as you go up the scale, skipping B. Ignore the Greek names.</p>
<h3 id="modes-in-polyphony">Modes in polyphony</h3>
<p>Theorists and musicians through the mid seventeenth century (with some later examples including in Bach and Beethoven) thought about polyphonic music in terms of mode as well. Mode was not a substitute for the later concept of key. It did not connote a whole system of harmonic functions (tonic, dominant, subdominant) like keys do. It did have other implications which we’ll get into.</p>
<p>But the basic idea was again practical, to match up polyphonic compositions in church music with monophonic chants. For example, you could match a polyphonic setting of an antiphon as a motet with the monophonic chanting of a psalm. (Remember, these techniques and styles coexisted from a very early date.)</p>
<p>The same two rules we discussed above apply here: the final and the ambitus, with the last note in the Bass voice used to determine the final, and the range of the Tenor voice to determine the ambitus. So a polyphonic composition in mode I (D, authentic) would end with the Bass on D. Because of the rules for consonance and dissonance, the final chord would either be just Ds, Ds and As (perfect consonances), or D, F#, and A. The Tenor voice would have notes ranging mostly from D to D.</p>
<p>But, you may be thinking, why would a piece in D Dorian end with a D major triad? I thought it was Dorian, not major! Like I said the modes didn’t mean things like minor vs. major. It mean that the piece ended on D. And it sounded better to 16th- and 17th-century people to sharp the F in that last chord, even if all the other D chords in the piece had the minor third with F natural. Likewise in many cases the chords on G would have B flats in them (as though the piece were in D minor), but because of small-scale patterns like the <em>una nota super la</em> rule where A–B–A would need to be sung A–Bb–A in <em>musica ficta</em>.</p>
<h3 id="transpositions-cantus-durus-and-cantus-mollis">Transpositions: <em>Cantus durus</em> and <em>cantus mollis</em></h3>
<p>There was an option to transpose the modes down a fifth by adding a flat to the (not key) signature. The signature with no flats or sharps was called <em>cantus durus</em>, and the one with a single B flat in the signature was called <em>cantus mollis</em>. In <em>cantus mollis</em>, mode I was on G, mode III was on A, and so on.</p>
<p>Sometimes this system was used as a notational convenience, to make it easier to fit music on the staves for example. Other times it had symbolic associations. Just as adding individual flats often indicated a shift “downwards” in the circle of fifths, so shifting the whole system down also sometimes was treated as a shift from one realm to another. Music in <em>cantus mollis</em> could be used to signify heavenly music, for example, while music in <em>cantus durus</em> (in the same piece) would signify earthly music, but this would be specific to particular traditions and individual pieces. In Monteverdi’s <em>L’Orfeo</em>, when Orfeo sings “Tu se’ morta,” the music shifts from <em>cantus durus</em> to <em>mollis</em> as it moves from the messenger’s hard and “bitter” news to Orpheus’s words of grief (and perhaps also foreshadowing his journey to the underworld, but that’s more speculative).</p>
<h3 id="the-transition-to-keys-and-functional-tonality">The transition to keys and functional tonality</h3>
<p>There was probably some larger scale harmonic thinking, though this is still an active research area, and different composers took different approaches. But some theorists did specify patterns of internal cadences in the different modes. For example, in mode I you might have cadences on D, F, A, and then D. A piece in mode II would also begin and end on D, but it would have a different pattern of internal cadences.</p>
<p>The combination of <em>ficta</em> alterations and conventions for harmonic movement like this led in some places and traditions to a system of “church keys” or <em>tonoi</em> which were something in between modes and keys. Eventually the 12 modes got boiled down to a smaller number of church keys, and those tended to be defined more and more by whether they featured a major or minor third, with sixth and seventh “scale degrees” being inflected more and more the same way in different ones, so that eventually it worked out to just major or minor. But the subtleties of this intermediary system led to some of the idiosyncracies we see later in why composers chose certain keys, and why they modulated to certain areas where we might not expect them to. The theory you get by tracing historical practice forward in time is very different than what you get by looking back and trying to come up with a rational system afterwards.</p>
<p>What was the difference between a piece in mode V (on F) in <em>cantus durus</em> and a piece in mode XI (on F) in <em>cantus mollis</em>? Both had the same final, both had the same authentic ambitus for the Tenor. Obviously the piece in <em>cantus mollis</em> would feature B flats, but singers would add flats to most of the Bs in the piece in <em>cantus durus</em> as well. So in practice there wasn’t much of a difference, and this is the sort of thing that led to the replacement of this system by major and minor keys on every note, but not for a long time (just like we still talk about the sun “coming up” even though we know it is the earth that is moving).</p>
<p>As early as the end of the 16th century, the theorist Zarlino said that in practice more and more musicians were using what he called his “new modes” 10 (sounds like A minor) and 11 (sounds like C major), especially guitarists and in dance music. Organists also tended to use these modes more frequently to accompany hymn or psalm singing. In all cases, this made sense because of the practical layout of chords on the guitar and because of the effectiveness of tonic–dominant alternations on signaling beginnings, endings, and transitions, all of which is necessary in dance music and in congregational singing.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-play-figured-or-unfigured-bass">How to play figured (or unfigured) bass</h2>
<p>In figured bass, the composer writes the bass note and numbers (“figures”) to indicate intervals above the bass. As J. S. Bach would later write, a keyboard player “plays the bass line with his left hand and adds consonances and dissonances above the bass with his right hand according to the figures.” Where there were no figures, the default was 8/5/3 (a “root position triad” in modern theory). You used whatever notes would naturally fall at those positions in the key signature: so a G with no figures in cantus durus would be a modern G major chord, but a G with no figures in cantus mollis would be a G minor chord.</p>
<p>A 6 usually meant 6/3 (“first inversion” – but again these people did not have that concept until Rameau in the eighteenth century, and even then J. S. Bach for one had no interest in some Frenchman’s newfangled concepts). It’s pretty straightforward, you just play the intervals that it says, in whatever way is comfortable and idiomatic on your instrument (that’s where the good voice leading you learned in theory comes in, but mostly as a function of just keeping your hand in the same place and trying to hear the notes connecting to each other).</p>
<p>Especially early in the seventeenth century you find a lot of unfigured bass. Assume everything is a 5/3 unless the melody tells you it has to be a six or something else. When in doubt use your ear. Keep in mind that 17th-century lutenists and organists could take the bass line of a Josquin motet and improvise an entire polyphonic motet above that bass line. So they learned to see patterns: for example for a piece in mode VII on G, if you saw the bass line D–F–G, you would probably sharp the F and play a six chord above it (so you get the sound of V–V6/3–I, but again that’s not at all how they thought of it). As already noted, players added sharps to the last chords on cadences a lot of the time, but we don’t know how much because obviously it wasn’t written down!</p>
<h2 id="text-setting-and-musical-rhetoric">Text setting and musical rhetoric</h2>
<p>I distinguish three basic approaches to setting words to music:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>text projection</li>
<li>text depiction</li>
<li>text expression</li>
</ol>
<p>Put simply, the first is what you do to make the text clearly audible and intelligible; the second is representing or painting the meaning of the text through symbolic gestures like “madrigalisms” (e.g., an ascending scale on the words “we go up,” or two voices on the words “two by two”). The third encompasses style, genre, and emotional expression; using more complex musical elements to amplify the effect of the text on the listener. All three overlap to an extent, and like any such breakdown this is artificial and doesn’t always apply.</p>
<p>There has been a lot written about musical rhetoric in the 17th and 18th centuries, but as one of my teachers used to say, “we know less now than we used to.” People used to be very confident that you could take certain theoretical texts as a kind of dictionary to “decode” the meaning of Baroque music. A certain melodic gesture would be taken as “the figure of joy” and that would be an interpretive key. Caccini, Athanasius Kircher, and many others did write about rhetorical figures like <em>anaphora</em> (lifting up, like repeating something at a higher pitch level), <em>catabasis</em> (going down, like modulating to flats), and lots of other things with complicated Greek names.</p>
<p>Other scholars have tried to match up Roman models of how to organize a speech with early modern patterns of how to organize a musical form. The ancient Roman writer taught speakers to follow a pattern like this:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><em>Exordium</em>
<ul>
<li>a rousing introduction to get everyone’s attention and introduce the topic</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>Propositio</em> -
<ul>
<li>clear statement of the central argument (like a thesis statement in a college paper)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>Narratio</em>
<ul>
<li>discussion of the argument: this could be made up of pairs of the following:
<ol type="a">
<li><em>Confutatio</em>
<ul>
<li>entertain objections to the argument (“some might object…”)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>Confirmatio</em>
<ul>
<li>defeat those objections and reaffirm your main point (“but I say…”)</li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>Peroratio</em>
<ul>
<li>a rousing conclusion, usually with a call to action</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>Scholars have identified this pattern in German organ preludes by Buxtehude, and I have found it, or versions of it, in Spanish villancicos.</p>
<p>But no one agrees on any of this, and it has often been used as a much too simplistic way of interpreting the meaning of music, as though you could “prove” what it meant by identifying a pattern that is labeled in a music treatise. In reality the meaning of music arose from a complex interaction of musical conventions and expectations within a listening community, and it was different for different listeners. We can try to recover what a range of plausible interpretations might have been for a particular community at a particular time by combining lots of different types of analysis and interpretation, in context with other arts and related sources (like theological texts relevant to church music), and what we can learn about the historical circumstances of the work’s patronage and first performances (like when a work is commissioned by a king to celebrate a military victory). But in the end we are still the ones doing the interpreting, it is our ears we are using. It does help, though, to try to use concepts the musicians at the time actually used.</p>
<h1 id="disclaimer-and-further-reading">Disclaimer and Further Reading</h1>
<p>Like all the other class notes on this site, this page is intended to summarize the things we talked about in class, and fill in some gaps for things we didn’t quite get to, or where I felt like something needed more explanation. This is not a textbook; it hasn’t been peer-reviewed; I don’t cite my sources. Some of the details, especially dates, may be off a little bit (and I welcome corrections), but the goal here is to give you the big picture, to help you connect the dots of the music we are listening to.</p>
<p>The best scholarly information in one volume is probably in <em>The Cambridge History of Seventeenth-Century Music</em>. The bibliographies there are a guide to more good scholarship on the subtopics like early Italian opera, music and the sciences, or 17th-century music theory. On theory, in addition to the good articles in that book, see also the relevant chapters in <em>The Cambridge History of Western Music Theory</em>.</p>
<p>For nuts-and-bolts basic information, look at Peter Burkholder’s <em>History of Western Music</em>, the most recent edition. For more select examples of music with analysis and context, see the accompanying <em>Norton Anthology of Western Music</em>. More in-depth coverage of this period can be found in the textbooks by John Walter Hill and Wendy Heller, among others. Primary sources (focused primarily on Italian, French, and German music) may be found in Strunk and Treitler, ed., <em>Source Readings in Music History</em>.</p>
<p>If you want to see how I analyze and interpret vocal music using 17th-century theory, read my monograph, <em>Hearing Faith: Music as Theology in the Spanish Empire</em> (Brill, 2020) or my articles, which also deal with the issues of changing worldviews and music’s role in colonialism.</p>
