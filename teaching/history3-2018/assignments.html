            <p>
               Develop an original research project in which you attempt to answer your own research
               question related to Western music between approximately 1730 and 1850 and connecting
               to themes of the course.
               Write a paper that contributes to a conversation among scholars and students
               by offering your own insight, perspective, theory, or interpretation.
               
            </p>
            
            <p>
               <strong>Present a single, clear, persuasive central argument and support
                  this argument with evidence</strong> from musical sources, documentary sources, and 
               secondary scholarship.
               Every paragraph should begin with a topic sentence that clearly connects the ideas
               and evidence presented in that paragraph to your central argument.
               
            </p>
            
            <p>
               <strong>Musical analysis</strong> should be a substantial component of the paper 
               (e.g., talking about notes).
               Try to find the intersections between <strong>the sonic and the social</strong> 
               aspects of music-making.
               
            </p>
            
            <p>
               Provide a full and responsible <strong>citation</strong> for every source that 
               you use in any consistent style (Chicago notes-and-bibliography style recommended,
               
               see <cite>Chicago Manual of Style</cite> online via UR library website).
               There must be a citation with page number for every direct quotation.
               Every use of someone else’s literal words must be quoted and cited; every use of someone
               else’s thoughts must be acknowledged and cited.
               
            </p>
            
            <p>
               The writing should be <strong>free from mistakes like spelling and punctuation or grammatical
                  errors.</strong>
               See <a href="#style">below</a> for notes on style.
               
            </p>
            
            <p>
               <strong>Submit the document on paper, 12-point font, 1-inch margins</strong>. 
               With this format the paper
               should be between four and six pages in length, <strong>1,600–2,000 words</strong>.
               
            </p>
            
            <p>
               The <strong>draft</strong> should be a complete, finished document with all citations and text complete.
               The <strong>final version</strong> should incorporate revisions based on feedback from 
               your professor and teaching assistant and should be as polished as possible.

               <p>
                  Tell me what you have to say, in as direct and plain a way as you can.
                  Writing for an academic research paper on music should be more formal than a blog
                  post
                  but less stiff and objective as a lab report.
                  Feel free to use the first person when necessary.
                  Your argument should logical and based on evidence, but in the end this is your interpretation.
                  
               </p>
               
               <p>
                  Make a specific, concrete argument that contributes to a scholarly discussion. 
                  It’s not enough to say <q>This paper is about Schubert’s music and physical height.</q>
                  or even <q>This paper explores the way that Schubert’s music is linked to his physical 
                     height.</q>
                  Instead, write <q>Scholar X claims that you can tell Schubert was short based on the way
                     he wrote for the bassoon.
                     But this argument uncritically applies modern concepts of shortness and tallness and
                     ignores
                     important evidence about Schubert’s actual relationship with the bassoon.
                     On the basis of Y evidence, however, I argue that Schubert wrote as he did for the
                     bassoon
                     because of reason Z.</q>
                  
               </p>
               
               <p>
                  Everything in the paper, then, should relate directly to that central argument. 
                  Don’t waste time on generalizations like the famous <q>dawn of time</q> introduction:
                  <q>Music has been an important part of human life from the dawn of time. 
                     Among the many humans who have lived on the earth and done music, Beethoven is one
                     of them.</q>
                  Leave this sort of thing to <a href="http://parksandrecreation.wikia.com/wiki/Perderick_L._Hapley">Perd
                     Hapley</a>.
                  Be as specific as possible, at all times.
                  Refer to specific measure numbers, words, musical structures, people, and institutions,
                  in specific places and on specific dates.
                  
               </p>
               
               <p>
                  Tell a story about people.
                  Use active verbs with human subjects: instead of writing <q>Passive voice is avoided by
                     effective writers in the humanities,</q> write <q>Effective writers in the humanities 
                     avoid passive voice.</q>
                  When writing about music, keep your reader’s attention on
                  music as a performance happening in time, in a social context: instead of writing
                  <q><cite>Son’ qual nave</cite> features many trills,</q> write
                  <q>In <cite>Son’ qual nave</cite>, Farinelli seized the attention of distractable
                     opera audiences and thrilled them with long trills on high notes and fast runs from
                     one
                     end of his range to the other.</q>
                  
               </p>
               
               <p>
                  For the perfectionists: No paper is ever really finished. You cannot find every source
                  or think through every possible orientation. Just write something up that represents
                  what 
                  you have to say about this right now. Write all the way to the end before you go back
                  and revise.
                  
               </p>
               
               <p>
                  For everyone: Write about something you care about. Let your love of music shine through
                  in the paper.
                  Don’t be afraid to make a bold claim. Have fun with it and be creative.
