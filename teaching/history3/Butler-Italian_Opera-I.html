        <h3>Reading questions</h3>

        <h4>General</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>What is the primary focus of this chapter? Why did the author,
                Margaret Butler, decide not organize the chapter around
                composers and their works?</li>
            <li>How are operas like suits of clothes?</li>
            <li><p>
                The goal of reading this chapter should be to understand, at a
                basic level, how opera was created in the eighteenth
                century&mdash;the cities and institutions that fostered it, and
                how they did so; the types of opera performed in these places;
                and the main composers and the types of opera they
                composed&mdash;and to understand the main conventions of the
                most common opera types (serious opera, or <em>opera seria</em>,
                and comic opera, or <em>opera buffa</em>).
                </p>
                <p>
                The nitty-gritty details like the Italian names of theaters and
                dates of specific operas are less important than the big
                picture: focus on the main types of theaters, the most prominent
                cities, the main distinctions of different kinds of opera, and
                pay attention to things mentioned repeatedly.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Some names to look out for:
                <ul>

                    <li>Alessandro Scarlatti</li>
                    <li>Leonardo Vinci</li>
                    <li>Giovanni Baptista Pergolesi</li>

        <h5>Seventeenth-century origins</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>(Pp. 204-205) Distinguish between <em>court operas</em> and
                <em>commercial</em> or <em>public</em> operas in the seventeenth
                century. Who funded each kind, who attended, and what was the
                role of the audience?
                (Monteverdi's <cite>L'Orfeo</cite> is an example of a
                court opera, and Cavalli's <cite>Giasone</cite> is an example of
                a commercial opera.)</li>
            <li>What were the responsibilities of an <em>impresario</em>?</li>
            <li>(206) What was a <em>principal theater</em>? What was performed
                there and who attended?</li>
            <li>What was a <em>secondary theater</em>? What was performed there
                and who attended</li>
            <li>(207) In general terms, what dichotomy characterizes the theater
                types?</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Principal and secondary theaters</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>(208) What were five common seasons for opera during the year?
                How was Naples different?</li>
            <li>Voice types were arranged hierarchically, with these principal
                roles:
                <table>
                    <tr>
                        <td><em>Primo uomo</em></td>
                        <td>First man</td>
                        <td>Usually a soprano <em>castrato</em>, a male singer
                            who had been castrated before puberty to preserve
                            his high voice (yes, they did this), and whose life
                            ever after had been dedicated to virtuoso
                            singing</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><em>Prima donna</em></td>
                        <td>First woman</td>
                        <td>Usually a soprano</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Tenor</td>
                    </tr>
                </table>
            </li>
            <li>Who were the main composers at the principal theaters in
                Naples?</li>
            <li>You can skim the material on Milan and Turin, but do note: how
                old was Mozart (born in 1756) when his first opera was performed
                in Milan?</li>
            <li>Who ran these principal theaters?</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Opera seria: Origins and conventions</h5>

        <ul>
            <li><em>This is the most important part of the chapter to study!</em></li>
            <li>This would be a good time to listen to the music by Broschi and
                Vinci on the syllabus.</li>
            <li>(221) Who were the leading composers of 
                <em>opera seria</em>?</li>
            <li>(222) What terms were used in the eighteenth century for opera
                of this type?</li>
        </ul>

        <h6>Goals of drama and poetry</h6>
        <ul>
            <li>What were the goals of the reformers in the Arcadian Academy in
                Rome?</li>
            <li><em>Aristotelian unities</em> refers (basically) to the concept,
                taken from the ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle's writings on
                drama, that a drama should all take place in a single place and
                time.</li>
            <li>What were most serious operas about? What central dilemma did
                they dramatize?</li>

            <li><em>Lieto fine</em> means <q>happy ending</q>.</li>
            <li><em>Versi sciolti</em> are freely organized Italian verses,
                often of 11-syllable lines that do not rhyme (compare to the
                English <q>blank verse</q> of Shakespeare)</li>
        </ul>

        <h6>Elements of the opera</h6>
        <ul>
            <li>What were the types and occasions for arias?</li>
            <li>Distinguish between <em>recitativo semplice</em> (simple
                recitative) and <em>recitativo accompagnato</em> (accompanied
                recitative).</li>
            <li>What is the form of a <em>da capo aria</em>? (Cf. Broschi,
                <cite>Son qual nave</nave>)</li>
            <li>A <q>suitcase aria</q> is one that a star singer would carry
                from place to place and demand on performing in any opera
                (possibly without regard to the story or character). <cite>Son
                    qual nave</cite> was the famous suitcase aria of the
                greatest castrato, Farinelli, composed for him by his brother
                and notated with the kind of ornamentation that Farinelli
                improvised.</li>
            <li>(225) What was the role of spectacle and dance?</li>
            <li>How did audiences behave?</li>
            <li>(227) Refer to the Algarotti reading on the syllabus.</li>
        </ul>


        <h5>Secondary theaters and comic opera</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>What repertory did secondary theaters perform?</li>
            <li>What was an <em>intermezzo</em> and when was it performed? What
                dramatic themes or characters did it feature?</li>
            <li>How were <em>intermezzi</em> and <em>opera seria</em>
                related? How are both related to <em>opera buffa</em>?</li>
            <li>Where was Pergolesi's <cite>La serva padrona</cite> first
                performed and where? When did it go abroad?</li>
            <li>The <em>Querelle des bouffons</em> (dispute of the buffoons or
                clowns) was a controversy in Paris about the relative merits of
                Italian comic opera compared to French operatic traditions. See
                the Rousseau reading on the syllabus.</li>
            <li>(235) The Neapolitan <em>conservatories</em> were originally
                orphanages where the children were taught music both for their
                discipline and to raise money for the institution. 
                The conservatory teachers developed ingenious methods for
                teaching musical performance and composition using memory
                devices and stock patterns, and the techniques and style
                developed in the conservatories came to dominate European music
                through the beginning of the nineteenth century.</li>
            <li>Who were some prominent <q>alumni</q> of the conservatories in
                Naples?</li>
        </ul>
