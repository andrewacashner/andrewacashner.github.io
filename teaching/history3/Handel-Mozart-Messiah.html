        <h2>Handel's <cite>Messiah</cite> and Mozart's Arrangement</h2>
        <h3>Aria, <q>O Thou That Tellest Good Tidings to Zion</q></h3>

        <h4>General questions to consider</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>How does Mozart pay homage to Handel?</li>
            <li>What does Mozart do that was old-fashioned in his time, and what
                that was new?</li>
            <li>(The really big-picture question) How was the Western canon
                created? What defines the <q>Classical tradition</q> in
                music?</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Handel's version, London, 1741</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>What genre is <cite>Messiah</cite>?</li>
            <li>What is the basic formal structure of this aria?</li>
            <li>What are the main characteristics of its style? What about this
                is typical of <q>High Baroque</q> style? What seems more like
                <q>Classical</q> style?</li>
            <li>Identify three main sections.
                <ul>
                    <li>For the first section, analyze the harmony and phrasing
                        together, using only I, V, and V/V (ignoring
                        transpositions and passing chords).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Identify instances of word painting and general affective
                expression.</li>
            <li>Match up recurring motives from the ritornello with the verbal
                phrases to which they are set.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Mozart's version, Vienna, 1789</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>If you were Mozart, what features of the music would you want to
                emphasize, adapt, or mitigate? What elements would be most
                interesting to you?</li>
            <li>What does Mozart keep the same and awhat does he add? Look at
                instrumentation (make sure you know how to read the transposing
                parts), articulation, structure?</li>
            <li>What does he highlight or downplay?</li>
            <li>Do his additions change the character of the piece?</li>
            <li>Does this version lend itself to a different performing
                style?</li>
        </ul>
