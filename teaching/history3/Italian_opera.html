        <h3>Riccardo Broschi, <cite>Son qual nave</cite> (1734)</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>Composed for Riccardo's brother Carlo, the famous castrato known
                as Farinelli</li>
            <li><q>Suitcase aria</q> interpolated into <cite>Artaserse</cite>
                with libretto by Metastasio</li>
            <li>Historical account of this aria's performance, from A. Burgh,
                <cite>Anecdotes of Music, Historical and Biographical</cite>
                (London, 1814), Vol. III, Letter 62 (p. 89):
                <blockquote>
                In the year 1734, as we have already observed, he [Farinelli]
                came to England, where the effects which his surprising talents
                had upon the audience, were ecstasy! rapture! enchantment!
                In the famous air, Son qual Nave, which was composed for him by
                his brother, the first note he sung, was taken with such
                delicacy, swelled by minute degrees to such an amazing volume,
                and afterwards diminished in the same manner to a mere point,
                that it was applauded for full five minutes.
                After this he set off with such brilliancy, and rapidity of
                execution that it was difficult for the violins of those days to
                keep pace with him.
                In short, in comparison with all other singers, he was as
                superior as the famous horse Childers, to all other racers.

                    Perhaps this penance
                    will make her reconsider the way she treated her master. If
                    it's true, what she told me, such a husband will be a terror
                    to her: terror of the the stick. Ah! The poor thing!

                    <br />
                    And besides, I was thinking... but she's a servant... but it
                    wouldn't be the first time... Well then, would you marry
                    her? Enough... Oh no, no, never. Go, ribald thoughts! Get
                    out of here. Still, I brought her up, from when she was born
                    Eh! you're crazy! Softly, for heaven's sake! Eh... better
                    not think of it. But... I have a fondness for her, And yet,
                    that wretched girl... She's coming back... Oh, god! I'm back
                    where I started. Oh what confusion.<br />
                    <br />
                    I am all mixed up. I have something in my heart, And I don't
                    know if it's love or if it's pity. I hear a voice telling
                    me: Uberto, consider yourself. I stand between yes and no,
                    Between “I want” and between “I don't want,” And more and
                    more I am mixed up. Ah! Miserable, unlucky, what will become
                    of me!
