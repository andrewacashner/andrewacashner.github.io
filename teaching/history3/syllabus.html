                     This course, as part of a four-semester sequence of courses in the history of Western
                     music for music majors, will give you the opportunity to engage in the close study
                     of practices of music-making from around 1730 to 1850 in Europe and its colonies.
                     Our primary goal is to deepen our understanding of music by learning to think about
                     music historically.
                     This means that we want to understand how musical practices have changed over time,
                     and how music fits into a broader history of culture.
                     We will pursue a holistic view of music history through a dialectic approach that
                     moves back and forth between sonic and social aspects of music.
                     By building broad knowledge of representative examples of music composed and performed
                     in this period across multiple social settings (opera house, church, home, concert
                     hall), and through in-depth analysis of a smaller repertoire, you will develop a conceptual
                     framework for making sense of music from 1730 to 1850 in a way that is relevant to
                     contemporary concerns.
                     Our emphasis is on the complex music patronized by the upper classes of Europe, which
                     they came to regard as part of a canon of classic masterworks; but we will consider
                     also oral and mass-mediated popular traditions, and we will pay attention to the musical
                     creativity of women, people of color, and disadvantaged groups.
                     The course will equip you to make your own decisions about how to tell the story of
                     music and to help write the next chapter through your own historically-informed music-making.

                        Develop skills in close reading/listening and in analytical and historical writing.

                        Select one symphony composed between 1730 and 1780, and another from 1780 to 1830.
                        Compare and contrast how the composers use the conventions of the symphony genre and
                        the sonata–allegro form especially.
                        Connect their musical technique to their social setting, drawing on primary and secondary
                        sources.
                        Examples of primary sources include the Strunk Source Readings, letters by the composer,
                        reviews of early performances, diary entries.
                        Examples of secondary sources include scholarly articles and books about the social
                        world of symphonies in this period.

                        Your essay should include a general analysis of two complete symphonies, and a detailed
                        analysis of two first movements in sonata–alegro form. Your analysis should not attempt
                        to account for every aspect of the piece or go bar-by-bar through the score; instead
                        you should focus on certain problems in the music related to your argument (e.g.,
                        harmonic movement in the slow introductions, motivic development in the retransition,
                        music topics like learned style or horn calls).

                        The purpose of the essay is not to demonstrate that later symphonies are better than
                        earlier ones, but to understand how and why the genre changed.

                  This course fulfills university requirements for five credit hours. 
                  The class meets for two sessions per week with the professor, each containing 90 minutes
                  of instructional time.
                  The class meets for one workshop session per week with the teaching assistant, for
                  50 minutes of instructional time.
                  Students are expected to do about 30 minutes of work outside of class in addition
                  to the normal time expected for study and assignments.
                  Normally this will consist of work on the group project and individual writing assignments.

                  Please check both the Blackboard site and your e-mail every day for
                  announcements from this class.  Make sure you have configured Blackboard
                  to send announcements and site changes to your e-mail address, and make
                  sure you have your university e-mail set up so that you can check it
                  easily.  You may contact me through my e-mail (listed at the beginning of
                  the syllabus), and I will respond as soon as I can during normal business
                  hours.  Be advised that I may not be able to respond to e-mails on
                  evenings, weekends, or holidays until the start of the next business day.

               <p>
                  I will take attendance at every class, and the teaching assistant will
                  take attendance at every workshop. 
                  You will learn best if you come to 
                  every class and get involved as fully as you can in whatever we are doing 
                  in the classroom.
                  That involvement starts before you come to class as you prepare each class
                  session’s listening and reading assignments, as you write your
                  weekly assignment, and as you do your other coursework alone and with your
                  classmates.
                  
               </p>

                  You can find the detailed listings, including links to online texts and music,
                  by clicking on the heading for each class session on the schedule page.
                  You are expected listen to and read all of the assigned material 
                  <em>before</em> you come to class that day.

                  <strong>Workshops</strong> are an important component of the class, in
                  which you have the opportunity to work in smaller groups with the teaching
                  assistant on a variety of tasks and topics.  These are meant to be
                  hands-on learning opportunities to build your skills and give you the
                  chance to get help in learning; as well as allowing us to deal with some
                  topics that don’t fit as well in the format of the rest of the class.

               <p>
                  The materials for this course are mostly online through this site and Blackboard,
                  so you will need to have a way to access this material in class.
                  
                  Phones can work, but for reading scores a larger screen will be useful.
                  It is certainly possible to look on with classmates.
                  In-class group work will also require internet access for research.
                  If the use of electronic devices in class presents a hardship for you, please
                  let me know and we can find a solution.

               <p>
                  Since we will be using devices in class, you must find a way to keep focus by eliminating
                  distractions on the devices (e.g., turning off notifications).
                  We all must make every effort, with devices or not, to connect with each other as
                  human
                  beings, making eye contact, listening actively, and being mentally present to each
                  other.

                  Submit PDF files only.
                  I will not accept assignments via e-mail, hard copy, or in any format other than PDF.

                  Assignments are due on the date listed in the syllabus.  Assignments
                  turned in after that time will be considered late (Blackboard tracks this automatically),
                  
                  and a penalty will be deducted from the grade (minus one letter grade for each day
                  late).  
                  Unless you arrange an extension with me in
                  advance, which I must confirm in writing, I will not accept assignments
                  more than four days after the original due date.

                        prohibits and will not engage in discrimination or harassment on the
                        basis of age, color, disability, ethnicity, gender identity or

                        makes a complaint of discrimination or harassment on the basis on a

                     Your success in this course is important to me, and every University of

                     successfully.  If you require accommodations for a documented

                     Office of Disability Resources: 1-154 Dewey Hall,

                     Please notify me, or have the disability office notify me, of any needed accommodations
                     as early as possible in the semester or it will become more difficult to make the
                     necessary adjustments.

                     All disability accommodations require official documentation from the Office of Disability
                     Resources. The office does not tell professors the nature of the disability, only
                     specific accommodations that we should make.
                     Disability can include mental health problems and chronic illnesses.
                     If a disability requires you to miss class frequently, please contact the disability
                     office and have them let me know how I can accommodate you.
                     The disability office must have the final say in questions of accommodations.

                     Academic honesty means avoiding anything that would unfairly advance your academic
                     standing over that of your classmates, such as cheating on
                     an exam or presenting someone else’s work as your own.  Plagiarism
                     includes any verbatim copying; unattributed, incorrectly attributed,
                     false, or misleading citations; or unacknowledged help from others

                     how to comply with the Academic Honesty Policy in your collaborative
                     work.  If you are not sure whether something counts as plagiarism or
                     academic dishonesty, I can help you if you ask me about it before
                     turning in the assignment.

                     <em>Every</em> instance of academic dishonesty will be reported to the College’s Board on Academic
                     Honesty.
                     The typical penalty for plagiarism on an assignment is a grade of zero in the assignment
                     and a one-third reduction in the total letter grade for the course.
                     Penalties for repeat or egregious offenses can extend to a grade of XE in the course
                     or suspension from the university.
                     Please note that plagiarism on a draft is typically treated as a separate infraction
                     from plagiarism on a final revision of the same paper.
