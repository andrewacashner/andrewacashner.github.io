                  <p>
                     This course, as part of a four-semester sequence of courses in the history of Western
                     music for music majors, will give you the opportunity to engage in the close study
                     of practices of music-making from around 1730 to 1850.
                     Our primary goal is to deepen our understanding of music by learning to think about
                     music historically.
                     This means that we want to understand how musical practices have changed over time,
                     and how music fits into a broader history of culture.
                     We will pursue a holistic view of music history through a dialectic approach that
                     moves back and forth between sonic and social aspects of music.
                     In other words we will paying attention both to the sound of music—its formal structure,
                     style, and conventions—and to its functions in society, including elements like patronage,
                     economics, politics, and ideology, and its connections to other arts.
                     Our primary sources are notated music, written descriptions of improvised practices,
                     and historical documents of how music was composed, performed, paid for, and enjoyed;
                     and we will also engage with recent scholarly research.
                     By building broad knowledge of representative examples of music composed and performed
                     in this period across multiple social settings (opera house, church, home, concert
                     hall), and through in-depth analysis of a smaller repertoire, you will develop a conceptual
                     framework for making sense of music from 1730 to 1850 in a way that is relevant to
                     contemporary concerns.
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>
                     The course focuses on musical life in Europe and its colonies, especially in America,
                     with particular attention to way that the educated upper classes of these regions
                     came to regard a certain body of musical compositions as a canon of classic masterworks.
                     We will study the history of <q>innovation within tradition</q> as the continued performance of old music challenged composers to establish their
                     place in the tradition by extending and transforming earlier models.
                     The course will also consider the relationship between this tradition and other kinds
                     of music such as oral traditions of folk music and mass-mediated popular music, with
                     attention to the musical creativity of women, people of color, and disadvantaged groups.
                     With respect to the course-catalog description, this class will help you develop a
                     critical perspective on

                        <li>music’s role in shaping <q>the West,</q></li>
                        
                        <li>why certain people in the West came to view some music as <q>art</q>
                           distinct from other music, and
                        </li> 
                        
                        <li>how and why the concept of <q>masterpieces</q> of music developed
                           and how that concept continues to shape musical culture today, even
                           outside <q>Classical</q> music.

                     The course will equip you to make your own decisions about how to tell the story of
                     music and to help write the next chapter through your own historically-informed music-making.

                     <p>
                        Goal: Understand the dynamics between sonic and social aspects of music as they pertain
                        to changes in the genre of symphony over time.
                        Develop skills in close reading/listening and in analytical and historical writing.
                        Use evidence to construct a persuasive argument.
                        Revise and improve your writing based on feedback from readers.

                     <p>
                        Select one symphony from the <q>earlier</q> list below, and one from the <q>later</q> list.
                        Compare and contrast how the composers use the conventions of the symphony genre and
                        the sonata–allegro form especially.
                        Connect their musical technique to their social setting, using primary-source evidence
                        from the list below.

                     <p>
                        Your essay should include a general analysis of two complete symphonies, and a detailed
                        analysis of two first movements in sonata–alegro form. Your analysis should not attempt
                        to account for every aspect of the piece or go bar-by-bar through the score; instead
                        you should focus on certain problems in the music related to your argument (e.g.,
                        harmonic movement in the slow introductions, motivic development in the retransition,
                        music topics like learned style or horn calls).

                     <p>
                        The purpose of the essay is not to demonstrate that later symphonies are better than
                        earlier ones, but to understand how and why the genre changed.

                  I will take attendance at every class, and the teaching assistant will
                  take attendance at every workshop. 
                  You will learn best if you come to 
                  every class and get involved as fully as you can in whatever we are doing 
                  in the classroom.
                  That involvement starts before you come to class as you prepare each class
                  session’s listening and reading assignments, as you write your
                  weekly assignment, and as you do your other coursework alone and with your
                  classmates.

                  by clicking on the heading for each class session on the schedule page.
                  You are expected listen to and read all of the assigned material 
                  <em>before</em> you come to class that day.

                  <strong>Workshops</strong> are an important component of the class, in
                  which you have the opportunity to work in smaller groups with the teaching
                  assistant on a variety of tasks and topics.  These are meant to be
                  hands-on learning opportunities to build your skills and give you the
                  chance to get help in learning; as well as allowing us to deal with some
                  topics that don’t fit as well in the format of the rest of the class.

                  The materials for this course are mostly online through this site and Blackboard,
                  so you will need to have a way to access this material in class.

                  Phones can work, but for reading scores a larger screen will be useful.
                  It is certainly possible to look on with classmates.
                  In-class group work will also require internet access for research.
                  If the use of electronic devices in class presents a hardship for you, please
                  let me know and we can find a solution.

                  Since we will be using devices in class, you must find a way to keep focus by eliminating
                  distractions on the devices (e.g., turning off notifications).
                  We all must make every effort, with devices or not, to connect with each other as
                  human
                  beings, making eye contact, listening actively, and being mentally present to each
                  other.

                  Assignments are due on the date listed in the syllabus.  Assignments
                  turned in after that time will be considered late (Blackboard tracks this automatically),
                  
                  and a penalty will be deducted from the grade (minus one letter grade for each day
                  late).  
                  Unless you arrange an extension with me in
                  advance, which I must confirm in writing, I will not accept assignments
                  more than four days after the original due date.

                     as early as possible in the semester or it will become more difficult to make the
                     necessary adjustments.

                     All disability accommodations require official documentation from the Office of Disability

                     specific accommodations that we should make.
                     Disability can include mental health problems and chronic illnesses.
                     If a disability requires you to miss class frequently, please contact the disability
                     office and have them let me know how I can accommodate you.
                     The disability office must have the final say in questions of accommodations.

                     <em>Every</em> instance of academic dishonesty will be reported to the College’s Board on Academic
                     Honesty.
                     The typical penalty for plagiarism on an assignment is a grade of zero in the assignment
                     and a one-third reduction in the total letter grade for the course.
                     Penalties for repeat or egregious offenses can extend to a grade of XE in the course
                     or suspension from the university.
                     Please note that plagiarism on a draft is typically treated as a separate infraction
                     from plagiarism on a final revision of the same paper.
