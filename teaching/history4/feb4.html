        <h1>Instructions</h1>
        <p>
        We will transfer the schedule planned for today (on Mahler,
        Schoenberg, etc.) to the week after the midterm.
        Today please work through this outline about nationalism, with focus on
        Mussorgsky and Dvorak, and then leave at least 30 minutes for work with
        your roundtable groups.
        </p>
        <p>
        By Wednesday your group will need to submit your written briefing for
        the roundtable (see the assignments page), which should set up the
        problem you want to discuss and assign a reading and listening example
        for the class.

        <h1>Nationalism, conclusion from last week</h1>

        <section>
          <h1>Key Concepts</h1>
          <ol>
            <li>Self vs. Other; Unmarked (default) vs. Marked categories</li>
            <li>Imagined communities (from Benedict Anderson): 
              <p>
              Anderson argues that vernacular print media helped shape new
              concepts of national communities that though imaginary had real
              impact in the world (e.g., WWI); how would music fit into this
              theory?  How would public spaces become sites for imaginary
              communities to form (e.g., opera house, symphony hall)?
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>Unmarked (<q>universal</q>) style in late 19th cent. 
              (e.g., orchestral style and formal techniques of 
              middle Beethoven, Schubert, Mendelssohn, R. Schumann, etc.)</li>
            <li>Various styles marked as <q>Other</q>: Exoticism, <q>musical
                nationalism</q></li>
          </ol>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h1>Exoticism</h1>

          <p>
          Often-generic/stereotyped <q>Other</q>-sounding music, defining the
          Self by reference to an imaginary Other
          </p>
          <p>
          Example: Saint-SÃ¤ens Bacchanale.  
          Take each element of music and <q>Other</q> it in some way.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h1><q>Musical nationalism</q></h1>

          <p>
          Intentionally marking your own music as Other (with regard to the
          international default) in order to distinguish music as having a
          national character, especially deriving from an imagined
          <em>Volksgeist</em> (spirit of the Folk, based on musical and cultural
          sources closer to peasant culture and therefore to the land). Creating
          a conception of Self <em>as</em> Other. The result is something
          perceived as National at home (Self as Other in a good way), and
          marketable as exotic abroad.
          </p>

          <section>
            <h1>Dvorak in Europe</h1>
            <p>
            Example: Dvorak, Slavonic Dances for four hands (big market success,
            promoted by Brahms to his own publisher, put Dvorak on the map)
            </p>
            <p> 
            Dvorak, Dumky Trio middle movement. What is similar here to
            <q>normal</q> chamber music of the time (cf. Brahms Cello Sonata from
            prev. week)? What is different?  Dumky was a Czech dance type that
            alternated slow and fast sections. Look at elements of music to see
            how they have been Othered in the different sections, and to what
            degree? What are the social and economic constraints on how far Dvorak
            can go to make this sound Czech? (E.g., think about how someone like
            Amy Fay or C.V. Stanford would hear this.)
            </p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h1>Mussorgsky Boris Godunov.</h1>
            <p>
            The nationalist opera to end all nationalist
            operas. Based on Russian history, in Russian language, with musical
            style based on Russian language and folk sources. 
            </p>
            <p>
            Mussorgsky was one of a group of Russian nationalist composers (The
            Mighty Handful) but went much further than the others to radically
            remake the sound of music along Russian lines. The opening of the
            opera is based on (1) the sound of bells in Russian coronation/church
            ceremonial, (2) a tritone ostinato that divides the octave equally and
            thereby produces a sense of stasis (does it also symbolize evil or
            create an affect of foreboding/dread/doom?), (3) the style and (I
            think) actual quotations of Russian Orthodox church music, which is
            exclusively choral with no instruments, (4) a style for the vocal
            soloists that aims to match Russian inflection and speech-rhythm
            perfectly, and aims to continue after Wagner in the idea of an opera
            without artifice (i.e., no arias, recitatives). The whole stage
            spectacle presented to Russians an nationalist image of themselves and
            to the rest of the world an image of exotic faraway (primitive, etc.)
            Russia.
            </p>
            <p> 
            Mussorgsky was an alcoholic and died leaving many compositions
            unfinished. His colleage Nicolai Rimsky-Korsakov (also very important
            figure in music education in Russia, look it up) <q>finished</q> the
            works for him. What this really meant, though, was that Rimsky
            Europeanized many of the most radical Slavic elements to make the
            works more palatable to a broader audience. He gave them a glossy,
            professional orchestration and smoothed over the rough patches (which
            were, arguably, meant to be rough). (Dmitri Shostakovich would later
            try his own completions that aimed to stay closer to Mussorgsky's
            vision.) Consider again: What are the social and economic constraints
            on how nationalistic you could get in Othering your own music?  
            </p> 
            <p> 
            Compare to very opening of <cite>Pictures at an Exhibition</cite>.
            Think again about elements of music.  How many are altered here?
            (scale, meters, modal harmony, etc.) But then note the expression
            marking: <em>Nel modo russico</em>. What does this assume? That there
            is such a thing as <q>Russian style</q>; and that the best way to
            convey this idea to music readers is to express it <em>in
              Italian</em>. Good example of the challenge of being different and
            remaining intelligible at the same time. 
            </p>

          <section>
            <h1>Dvorak in America</h1>
            <p>Look up the history of the New World Symphony, and Dvorak's
            visit to America (New York and Spillville, Iowa) courtesy of J.
            Thurber, director of American Conservatory.
            Discuss Dvorak's article on American music and his proposed method 
            for developing a national music. Does this fit with our theory of 
            musical nationalism (think especially about Othering various
            elements of music).
            </p>
            <p>Sources: Dvorak read about Native American music in a newspaper
            article, and had African-American conservatory student Harry T.
            Burleigh (look into his subsequent composition career) sing <q>Negro
              spirituals</q> for him. The more important source, I would argue, 
            was European fantasy conceptions of America, such as those
            promulgated by James Fennimore Cooper's novels (<cite>Last of the
              Mohicans</cite>) and German artist Albert Bierstadt's paintings
            (do an image search). Dvorak specifically mentioned H. W.
            Longfellow's poem <cite>Song of Hiawatha</cite> as an inspiration
            (look up, cf. S. Coleridge-Taylor's cantata based on same text).
            This was a hugely popular fantasy of Native folklore with some real
            sources but primarily invented by the author. 
            </p>
            <p>We do not know for sure but there is reason to think the slow
            movement of the New World symphony is based on Hiawatha's funeral in
            Longfellow's poem. Go through the different sections: How does
            Dvorak do the the things he writes about in his article? How does he
            Other the various elements of music?
            </p>
            <p>
            Things to think about: 
            <ul>
              <li>The main English horn theme sounds like an imitation of an
                African-American spiritual. (So much so that it has since been
                given words and has <em>become</em> a spiritual, <cite>Goin'
                  Home</cite>!)
              </li>
              <li>Why would you use a Black spiritual to represent an Indian
                funeral lament?
              </li>
              <li>Why would American middle- to upper-class audiences buy into
                this? Why does no one ever point out how strange this
                combination is, still?</li>
              <li>Think about how different the situation for musical
                nationalism was (is?) in America than for Dvorak or Mussorgsky
                in Europe. First of all, up to this point the main goal of
                American music administrators and musicians had been to match
                the standard of European, especially German music (or at least
                the standard of the way the British matched German standards).
                The goal was to produce unmarked normal-style music, not
                something that sounded national. Partly this is a developing
                country trying to prove its worth on a world stage.
              </li>
              <li>Another part, though, is that the US did not have the same
                concept of blood-and-soil, of Volk culture, that European
                countries had (more similar to the UK with its cosmopolitan
                empire but at least they had the monarchy and centuries of
                tradition). The country was, in concept at least, based on a
                political idea, not ethnic or cultural unity. (Though in
                practice we can recognize that America's ruling classes thought
                of themselves as part of a broader Anglo-Saxon Western
                Civilization.) So who was the Volk in the United States?
              </li>
              <li>In other words, Dvorak's mishmash of references in the New
                World symphony might seem like offensive appropriation; but
                there is a way to read it as quite subversive in relation to
                American politics (though perhaps not intentionally so). Because
                Dvorak is making, through his article and much more forcefully
                through  his music, the claim that the Volk of America are first
                and foremost, Native peoples and African-Americans. 
              </li>
              <li>
                At the same time, this was performed by all-white ensembles for
                all-white audiences. What is the difference between (1)
                including imitations of Indian or Black music in a symphony, (2)
                including actual Indian or Black music in a concert hall, (3)
                including actual Native American or African American
                <em>people</em> in the concert hall, (4) including them in the
                actual fabric of civil society?
              </li>
              <li>How many attempts to create musical diversity even today
                actually paper over the reality of social segregation and
                inequality?
              </li>
            </ul>
