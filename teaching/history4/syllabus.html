                  This course, as the culmination of a four-semester sequence in the history of Western
                  music,
                  equips students to make sense of the world of music today by developing a historical
                  understanding of music from about 1850 to the present.
                  Our goal continues to be a holistic understanding of music-making in human life that
                  
                  integrates the sonic and social elements of music.
                  
               </p>
               
               
               <p>
                  There is not a single tradition of music in this period, even in the West, 
                  and therefore we will
                  trace multiple overlapping histories that acknowledge diverse perspectives.
                  One aspect of the course explores the history of so-called 
                  Western art music as both a musical tradition and an ideological concept.
                  In this period, the term can actually refer to two traditions—the Classical
                  performance tradition and the modernist compositional tradition.
                  Even as we seek to understand the music and ideas of these traditions, we will
                  also consider the other diverse traditions that have continually intersected
                  with them, such as film music, musical theater, and mass-mediated popular music
                  like jazz, rock, and hip hop.
                  We will also consider the musical creativity of women, African Americans, Latin
                  Americans, Asians, and members of lower social strata, whose contributions form
                  essential parts of the world of music today.
                  Nevertheless, the course focuses on historically significant examples that reward
                  close study;
                  it aims to provide both breadth and depth but with an emphasis on knowing a smaller
                  set 
                  of good examples in more detail.
                  
               </p>
               
               
               <p>
                  The course is structured in thematic and chronological units, each of which will
                  culminate in a roundtable session.
                  In the roundtables, small groups of students will discuss and debate the key
                  issues in the unit, based on creative research projects developed in each
                  group throughout the unit.
                  
               </p>
               
               
               <p>
                  There will be strong emphasis on active, critical listening, and on research
                  and writing.
                  The course will draw on original writings by prominent composers and musicians
                  to help students learn to think more critically about the changing role of music
                  and musicians in society, including questions of ethical responsibility and
                  political engagement.

                  With respect to the departmental course catalog

               <p>
                  I will take attendance at every class, and the teaching assistant will
                  take attendance at every workshop. We will be noting how much and how well you 
                  contribute to the class for your participation grade.
                  You will learn best if you come to 
                  every class and get involved as fully as you can in whatever we are doing 
                  in the classroom.
                  That involvement starts before you come to class as you prepare each class
                  session’s listening and reading assignments, as you write in your
                  listening journal, and as you do your other coursework alone and with your
                  classmates.

                  You can find the detailed listings, including links to online texts and music,
                  by clicking on the heading for each class session on the schedule page.
                  You are expected listen to and read all of the assigned material 
                  <em>before</em> you come to class that day.

                  <strong>Workshops</strong> are an important component of the class, in
                  which you have the opportunity to work in smaller groups with the teaching
                  assistant on a variety of tasks and topics.  These are meant to be
                  hands-on learning opportunities to build your skills and give you the
                  chance to get help in learning; as well as allowing us to deal with some
                  topics that don’t fit as well in the format of the rest of the class.

               <p>
                  The materials for this course are mostly online through this site and Blackboard,
                  so you will need to have a way to access this material in class.
                  Phones can work, but for reading scores a larger screen will be useful.
                  It is certainly possible to look on with classmates.
                  In-class group work will also require internet access for research.
                  If the use of electronic devices in class presents a hardship for you, please
                  let me know and we can find a solution.
                  
               </p>
               
               
               <p>
                  Since we will be using devices in class, you must find a way to keep focus by eliminating
                  distractions on the devices (e.g., turning off notifications).
                  We all must make every effort, with devices or not, to connect with each other as
                  human
                  beings, making eye contact, listening actively, and being mentally present to each
                  other.

               <p>
                  Please turn in assignments through the electronic submission portal on Blackboard.
                  Submit PDF files only.
                  I will not accept assignments via e-mail, hard copy, or in any format other than PDF.
                  
               </p>
               
               <p>
                  Use a basic 12-point font, double spaced, with one-inch margins on all sides.  
                  Be sure to include your name and the name and date of the assignment.  
                  
               </p>
               
               <p>
                  Assignments are due on the date listed in the syllabus.  Assignments
                  turned in after that time will be considered late (Blackboard tracks this automatically),
                  
                  and a penalty will be deducted from the grade (minus one letter grade for each day
                  late).  
                  Unless you arrange an extension with me in
                  advance, which I must confirm in writing, I will not accept assignments
                  more than four days after the original due date.
                  
               </p>
               
               <p>
                  I will only arrange makeups for exams in exceptional
                  circumstances such as a documented health or family emergency.
                  
               </p>
               
               <p>
                  Every member of a group must be present in class on the day of a presentation
                  unless you make arrangements with me in advance, confirmed in writing.

               <p>
                  It is my goal to build a safe, welcoming, and encouraging classroom
                  community for every student, and I invite you to join me in working toward
                  that goal.  I and my colleages in the Department of Music are fully
                  committed to preventing any kind of harassment or discrimination.  The
                  following is an excerpt from the university’s 
                  <a href="https://www.rochester.edu/eoc/HarassmentDiscrimination.html">

                        The University of Rochester seeks to provide a setting that respects
                        the contributions of all the individuals composing its community, that
                        encourages intellectual and personal development, and that promotes
                        the free exchange of ideas.

                     <p>
                        To ensure nondiscrimination and equal opportunity, the University
                        prohibits and will not engage in discrimination or harassment on the
                        basis of age, color, disability, ethnicity, gender identity or
                        expression, genetic information, marital status, military/veteran
                        status, national origin, race, religion/creed, sex, sexual
                        orientation, or any other status protected by law. The University also
                        prohibits retaliation and will not retaliate against any person who
                        makes a complaint of discrimination or harassment on the basis on a
                        protected status or who provides information or otherwise participates
                        in a investigation of such a complaint.

                     <p>
                        If you believe you have been discriminated against or harassed due to
                        your protected status, you have several options for how to respond.

                  There will be opportunities throughout the course for you to give feedback
                  anonymously on your learning experience, in addition to the university’s
                  student-evaluation process at the end of the semester.  If you have any
                  ideas for how this course could be improved, if you perceive any obstacles
                  to your learning, or if you need any kind of accommodation to help your
                  learning, please take advantage of these opportunities to let me know.
                  Otherwise please feel free to speak to me or e-mail me directly and I will
                  do the best I can to help you.

                     Your success in this course is important to me, and every University of
                     Rochester classroom respects and welcomes students of all backgrounds
                     and abilities.  I encourage you to talk with me about any concern or
                     situation that affects your ability to complete your academic work
                     successfully.  If you require accommodations for a documented

                     Please notify me, or have the disability office notify me, of any needed accommodations
                     as early as possible in the semester or it will become more difficult to make the
                     necessary
                     adjustments.

                     All assignments and activities associated with this course must be

                     Academic honesty means avoiding anything that would unfairly advance
                     your academic standing over that of your classmates, such as cheating on
                     an exam or presenting someone else’s work as your own.  Plagiarism
                     includes any verbatim copying; unattributed, incorrectly attributed,
                     false, or misleading citations; or unacknowledged help from others
                     (e.g., having someone else write a paper for you).

                     how to comply with the Academic Honesty Policy in your collaborative
                     work.  If you are not sure whether something counts as plagiarism or
                     academic dishonesty, I can help you if you ask me about it before
                     turning in the assignment.
