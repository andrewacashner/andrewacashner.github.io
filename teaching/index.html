<h4>PhD Seminar: Popular Song in Religious Devotion, 1500â€“1800</h4>

<p>
  This class, open to any doctoral students, will consider the role of singing in popular religious devotion during the early modern period.
  The class will consider how widely practiced musical customs in common or lower-class culture served to express and define religious beliefs and shape communities.
  We will approach these musical and spiritual community practices using methods from musicology, ethnomusicology, religious studies, anthropological ritual studies, and social history.
  We will examine the close relationship between music publications and contemporary devotional literature.
  We will also consider how popular devotional practices informed and were influenced by more cultivated or elite forms of religious music.
</p>
<p>
  The class will focus on four case studies:
<ol>
  <li>Reformed Psalm singing and its descendents: The <q>Old Way of Singing</q>, <q>Dr. Watts</q> Singing in African-American communities, shape-note singing</li>
  <li>Lutheran hymns and <q>spiritual songs</q></li>
  <li>Music on the Spanish and Portuguese missions</li>
  <li>Villancicos in Latin America and Spain</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
  Students will write major research papers, suitable for publication in an academic journal, on any related topic.
  Students outside the school of music are especially welcome.
  The class will recreate and experiment with these practices first-hand.
  At the same time, the musical materials studied will be primarily simple melodies, so no musical knowledge is required.
