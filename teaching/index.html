                      Music in New Worlds: Global Encounters in the Age 
                      of Discoveries, 1492 to 1800</a>
                    <p class="abstract">
                    After 1492, Europeans and other peoples around the globe
                    began to discover each other in new ways, and music played a
                    vital role in their encounters. 
                    This course equips students to develop a global perspective
                    on music in the early modern era.
                    Through case studies in Latin America, New England, China,
                    and Africa, students will gain insight into the ways people
                    use music as an agent of political and religious power in
                    processes of cultural exchange and conflict. 
                    The course examines how missionaries and colonial leaders
                    mixed musical cultures to build new social structures; and
                    how colonial subjects responded creatively, in collaboration
                    or resistance, to shape hybrid identities. 
                    We will study musical practices from both sides of the
                    encounters, including Chinese and Native American musics and
                    exported European practices like religious choral music and
                    popular dances.  
                    Meets in the Robbins Library or hands-on engagement with
                    rare books and manuscripts. 
                    No prior musical knowledge is required.

                    <p class="abstract">
                    This course equips students to understand the key role of
                    music in shaping the new identities and beliefs of the
                    Christian communities that emerged from the Reformations of
                    the sixteenth century: Lutherans, Calvinists, Anglicans, and
                    Roman Catholics, including colonial societies around the
                    globe.
                    We will study the link between faith, music, and community
                    in Lutheran chorales and Puritan psalms, Palestrina's masses
                    and J. S. Bach's Passions, and music from colonial Latin
                    America. 
                    In light of theological literature of the time we will study
                    how music served as a form of ritual and prayer for
                    communities and individuals. 
                    This historical knowledge will enable students to understand
                    the roots of living traditions of Christian worship today. 
                    No musical or theological background required.
