            <p>
               
               Select a primary source created between 1450 and 1800 from 
               UR’s Special Collections and Rare Books.
               (Use the guide and list on <a href="https://learn.rochester.edu"><abbr>BB</abbr></a> if it helps.)
               
               
            </p>
            
            <p>
               
               Prepare to <strong>present your source</strong> to the class in 
               <strong>not more than ten minutes</strong>.
               It is up to you whether to write out your presentation or speak more freely 
               from an outline.
               I recommend the latter, but in either case you cannot exceed ten minutes.
               
               
            </p>
            
            <p>
               
               Your presentation should include a <strong>printed handout</strong> 
               of not more than the 
               front and back of one sheet of paper (print ten copies).
               The handout should include:
               
               <ul>
                  
                  <li>the full citation for your source</li>
                  
                  <li>any information you have found out from the library or other sources about
                     the background of your source and its provenance (where the library got it)
                     
                  </li>
                  
                  <li>one key excerpt, illustration, or example that you discuss with the class</li>
                  
               </ul>
               
               
            </p>
            
            <p>
               
               Consider questions such as these:
               
               <ul>
                  
                  <li>What format is the book? (folio, quarto, octavo—look up these terms)</li>
                  
                  <li>What condition is the book in? (e.g., folded pages, fingerprints, handwriting, binding)</li>
                  
                  <li>How do you think the book was used and by what sort of people?</li>
                  
                  <li>What can the book tell us about (1) sound and/or music, 
                     and (2) intercultural encounter?
                  </li>
                  
               </ul>
               
               
            </p>
            
            <p>
               
               Your handout should also include a <strong>bibliography of at least two sources</strong> 
               that could help someone who wanted to learn more about this book, such as a
               modern edition or scholarly study of the source, or a more general scholarly
               study that would aid in understanding the subject matter or type of source.

            <p>
               Write a single-paragraph abstract for the paper you intend to write.
               The abstract should clearly and succinctly descripe your topic 
               (general area of research), your research question (what do you want to learn and
               why?), 
               and propose a possible central argument (what do you think you might have to say?
               what answers
               might your research provide to your question?). 
               You should discuss the kinds of primary and secondary sources you intend to use, though
               you do not
               need to list an actual bibliography at this stage.
