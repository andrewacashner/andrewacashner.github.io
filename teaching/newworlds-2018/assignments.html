            <p>
               
               Select a primary source created between 1450 and 1800 from 
               UR’s Special Collections and Rare Books.
               (Use the guide and list on <a href="https://learn.rochester.edu"><abbr>BB</abbr></a> if it helps.)
               
               
            </p>
            
            <p>
               
               Prepare to <strong>present your source</strong> to the class in 
               <strong>not more than ten minutes</strong>.
               It is up to you whether to write out your presentation or speak more freely 
               from an outline.
               I recommend the latter, but in either case you cannot exceed ten minutes.
               
               
            </p>
            
            <p>
               
               Your presentation should include a <strong>printed handout</strong> 
               of not more than the 
               front and back of one sheet of paper (print ten copies).
               The handout should include:
               
               <ul>
                  
                  <li>the full citation for your source</li>
                  
                  <li>any information you have found out from the library or other sources about
                     the background of your source and its provenance (where the library got it)
                     
                  </li>
                  
                  <li>one key excerpt, illustration, or example that you discuss with the class</li>
                  
               </ul>
               
               
            </p>
            
            <p>
               
               Consider questions such as these:
               
               <ul>
                  
                  <li>What format is the book? (folio, quarto, octavo—look up these terms)</li>
                  
                  <li>What condition is the book in? (e.g., folded pages, fingerprints, handwriting, binding)</li>
                  
                  <li>How do you think the book was used and by what sort of people?</li>
                  
                  <li>What can the book tell us about (1) sound and/or music, 
                     and (2) intercultural encounter?
                  </li>
                  
               </ul>
               
               
            </p>
            
            <p>
               
               Your handout should also include a <strong>bibliography of at least two sources</strong> 
               that could help someone who wanted to learn more about this book, such as a
               modern edition or scholarly study of the source, or a more general scholarly
               study that would aid in understanding the subject matter or type of source.

            <p>
               Write a single-paragraph abstract for the paper you intend to write.
               The abstract should clearly and succinctly descripe your topic 
               (general area of research), your research question (what do you want to learn and
               why?), 
               and propose a possible central argument (what do you think you might have to say?
               what answers
               might your research provide to your question?). 
               You should discuss the kinds of primary and secondary sources you intend to use, though
               you do not
               need to list an actual bibliography at this stage.

            <p>
               Develop an original research project in which you attempt to answer your own 
               research question related to the role of music in global intercultural 
               encounters, roughly in the period 1450–1800.
               Draw on primary sources, especially those available to you in UR’s Rare Books 
               and Special Collections; and engage with recent secondary scholarship in 
               musicology and relevant fields.
               
            </p>
            
            <p>
               Write a paper that contributes to a conversation among scholars and students
               by offering a new insight, perspective, or theory.
               Present a clear and persuasive central argument and supports
               this argument based on evidence from musical sources, documentary sources, and 
               secondary scholarship.
               Every paragraph should begin with a topic sentence that clearly connects the ideas
               and evidence presented in that paragraph to your central argument.
               Provide a full and responsible citation for every source that you use in any consistent
               style (Chicago notes-and-bibliography style recommended, 
               see <cite>Chicago Manual of Style</cite> online).
               
            </p>
            
            <p>
               Submit the document on paper, 12-point font, 1-inch margins. With this format the
               paper
               should be between seven and nine pages in length (2,500–3,000 words).
               
            </p>
            
         </section>
         
         
         <section id="presentation">
            
            <h1>Research Presentation</h1>
            
            
            <p>
               Present the gist of your research paper in class in an oral presentation 
               no longer than fifteen minutes in length including musical examples.
               The presentation should be in the style of an academic conference paper, 
               which means that you read from a complete prepared text. This allows you 
               to time the presentation reliably.
               
            </p>
            
            <p>
               You should estimate about 2.5 minutes of time per double-spaced, 12-point page: 
               thus your text should be 5–6 pages long.
               The simplest method is probably to read the introduction and conclusions of your 
               research paper verbatim, and give just an overview of the internal sections, 
               and focus on one or two key examples.
               Every presentation should include an example of sounding music. If no recording is
               available but there is notation, the professor and class members can sing or play
               it.
               
            </p>
            
            <p>
               Your presentation should be accompanied by a visual display of some kind, preferably
               a set of slides (e.g., PowerPoint, LaTeX Beamer).
               The slides should clarify the structure of your paper; provide helpful visual
               examples like architecture, art, images of primary archival sources; and display
               any complex or foreign terms or longer quotations.
               With visual presentations, less is more.
