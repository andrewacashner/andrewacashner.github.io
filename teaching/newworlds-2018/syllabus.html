            <p>
               After 1492, Europeans and other peoples around the globe began to
               discover each other in new ways, and music played a vital role in their
               encounters. This course equips students to develop a global
               perspective on music in the early modern era. Through case studies
               in Latin America, New England, China, and Africa, students
               will gain insight into the ways people use music as an agent of
               political and religious power in processes of cultural exchange and
               conflict. The course examines how missionaries and colonial leaders 
               mixed musical cultures to build new social structures;
               and how colonial subjects responded creatively, in
               collaboration or resistance, to shape hybrid identities.  
               We will study musical practices from both sides of the
               encounters, including Chinese and Native American musics and exported
               European practices like religious choral music and popular dances.
               Meets in the Robbins Library for hands-on engagement with rare books and manuscripts.
               
               No prior musical knowledge is required.

                  Unless you make arrangements with me in advance, which I must confirm in

                     All assignments and activities associeted with this course must be performed in
                     accordance with the University of Rochester’s 
                     <a href="http://www.rochester.edu/college/honesty">Academic Honesty Policy</a>.

                  <p>
                     Academic honesty means avoiding anything that would unfairly advance your
                     academic standing over that of your classmates, such as cheating on an exam or
                     presenting someone else’s work as your own.
                     Plagiarism includes any verbatim copying; unattributed, incorrectly attributed,
                     false, or misleading citations; or unacknowledged help from others (e.g., having
                     someone else write a paper for you).
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>
                     Group assignments will include specific additional instructions about how to
                     comply with the Academic Honesty Policy in your collaborative work.
                     If you are not sure whether something counts as plagiarism or academic
                     dishonesty, I can help you if you ask me about it before turning in the
                     assignment.
