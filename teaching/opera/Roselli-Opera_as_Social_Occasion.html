        <h2>John Roselli, <q>Opera as a Social Occasion</q></h2>
        <p>Parker, <cite>Oxford Illustrated History of Opera</cite>, ch. 12</p>

        <h3>General</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>How has the significance of opera <em>as a social event in a
                    particular community</em> changed?</li>
            <li>What were some of the reasons people of different sorts attended
                the opera, other than to hear music or see a drama?</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Specific</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>(454) How did the arrangement and behavior of the audience in
                court opera reflect the hierarchical social relationships of
                aristocratic society?</li>
            <li>(458) What were the boxes used for?</li>
            <li>(460) What were some distinguishing features of French opera
                houses and opera-goers as opposed to Italian ones?</li>
            <li>(462) How did people find out about opera?</li>
            <li>(465) What are some of the different types of people you would
                see working at the opera?</li>
            <li>Describe the range of normal audience behaviors before the late
                19th century. Consider dress, hygiene, recreation, and food.</li>
            <li>(477) How did audiences and performers communicate with each
                other?</li>
            <li>What did Richard Wagner change about the opera experience?</li>
            <li>What does the author, John Roselli, believe we have lost in the
                experience of opera in recent years? Do you think the trends he
                describes are still relevant today, since this was written in
                1994?</li>
