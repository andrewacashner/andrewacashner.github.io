                        and reading and identify research interests.
                        Enable your professor to track with your learning, identify interests and concerns,
                        need for further explanation or help, understand what motivates, excites, bothers
                        you.

                        Write a short essay each week in which you reflect on what you learned in the previous
                        week and respond to the reading and listening assignments for the coming week.
                        This is not a research paper, and you may express yourself freely, but the writing
                        should be clear and free from grammatical errors or sloppy mistakes.
                        In prior experience, consistently good work in weekly essays correlates strongly with
                        overall success in the course.

                        Choose a complete scene from any opera studied in this class.
                        Professor must approve your choice of scene.
                        Write an essay in which you analyze how the libretto, score, vocal performance, staging
                        (sets, costumes, movement), acting, and other relevant elements work together to produce
                        a dramatic effect.
                        The dramatic effect may be conveying a sense of character, conflict between characters,
                        plot action, a reflective break from plot action, a sense of climax, and so on.

                        If you can read music, you are encouraged to analyze the notated music to the extent
                        possible, and refer to the printed score in addition to any recordings you may consult.
                        If not, base your analysis on a particular recording and refer to specific track timings.
                        You do not need to use any technical musical vocabulary beyond what we have discussed
                        in class, but you do need to engage with the sound of music in whatever way you can.
                        Likewise you should analyze elements like lighting and dance even if you don’t know
                        the technical vocabulary for them.

                        This paper should be the result of your own analytical work.
                        You may not collaborate on any element of this project.
                        You do not need to do any research in secondary sources (e.g., books about the opera)
                        but as always you must cite any sources you do use.

                     on an opera <em>not</em> covered in the course.
                     Presentations should include the following elements:

                           score, first productions, reception (history of its performance and influence)

                           Analysis of an excerpt of the music (such as an aria or ensemble) that illustrates
                           characteristic features of how this opera works musically and dramatically, such as
                           distinctive techniques, timbres, or dramatic strategies

                           Presentation should be clear, well-prepared and organized, concise; it should raise
                           and hold the interest of someone generally interested in opera

                  sure you have your university e-mail set up so that you can check it
                  easily.  You may contact me through my e-mail (listed at the beginning of
                  the syllabus), and I will respond as soon as I can during normal business
                  hours.  Be advised that I may not be able to respond to e-mails on

                  I will take attendance at every class, and the teaching assistant will
                  take attendance at every workshop. 
                  You will learn best if you come to 
                  every class and get involved as fully as you can in whatever we are doing 
                  in the classroom.
                  That involvement starts before you come to class as you prepare each class
                  session’s listening and reading assignments, as you write your
                  weekly assignment, and as you do your other coursework alone and with your
                  classmates.

                  You can find the detailed listings, including links to online texts and music,
                  by clicking on the heading for each class session on the schedule page.
                  You are expected listen to and read all of the assigned material 
                  <em>before</em> you come to class that day.

                  <strong>Workshops</strong> are an important component of the class, in
                  which you have the opportunity to work in smaller groups with the teaching
                  assistant on a variety of tasks and topics.  These are meant to be
                  hands-on learning opportunities to build your skills and give you the
                  chance to get help in learning; as well as allowing us to deal with some
                  topics that don’t fit as well in the format of the rest of the class.

                  The materials for this course are mostly online through this site and Blackboard,
                  so you will need to have a way to access this material in class.

                  Phones can work, but for reading scores a larger screen will be useful.
                  It is certainly possible to look on with classmates.
                  In-class group work will also require internet access for research.
                  If the use of electronic devices in class presents a hardship for you, please
                  let me know and we can find a solution.

                  Since we will be using devices in class, you must find a way to keep focus by eliminating
                  distractions on the devices (e.g., turning off notifications).
                  We all must make every effort, with devices or not, to connect with each other as
                  human
                  beings, making eye contact, listening actively, and being mentally present to each
                  other.

                  Assignments are due on the date listed in the syllabus.  Assignments
                  turned in after that time will be considered late (Blackboard tracks this automatically),
                  
                  and a penalty will be deducted from the grade (minus one letter grade for each day
                  late).  
                  Unless you arrange an extension with me in

                     Your success in this course is important to me, and every University of
                     Rochester classroom respects and welcomes students of all backgrounds
                     and abilities.  I encourage you to talk with me about any concern or
                     situation that affects your ability to complete your academic work
                     successfully.  If you require accommodations for a documented
                     disability, or need to have a disability documented, please contact the
                     Office of Disability Resources: 1-154 Dewey Hall, 
                     <a href="mailto:disability@rochester.edu">disability@rochester.edu</a>,
                     (585) 275-9049.
                     Please notify me, or have the disability office notify me, of any needed accommodations
                     as early as possible in the semester or it will become more difficult to make the
                     necessary adjustments.
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>
                     All disability accommodations require official documentation from the Office of Disability
                     Resources. The office does not tell professors the nature of the disability, only
                     specific accommodations that we should make.
                     Disability can include mental health problems and chronic illnesses.
                     If a disability requires you to miss class frequently, please contact the disability
                     office and have them let me know how I can accommodate you.
                     The disability office must have the final say in questions of accommodations.

                     All assignments and activities associated with this course must be
                     performed in accordance with the University of Rochester’s 
                     <a href="http://www.rochester.edu/college/honesty">Academic Honesty 
                        Policy</a>.

                  <p>
                     Academic honesty means avoiding anything that would unfairly advance your academic
                     standing over that of your classmates, such as cheating on
                     an exam or presenting someone else’s work as your own.  Plagiarism
                     includes any verbatim copying; unattributed, incorrectly attributed,
                     false, or misleading citations; or unacknowledged help from others
                     (e.g., having someone else write a paper for you).
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>
                     Group assignments will include specific additional instructions about
                     how to comply with the Academic Honesty Policy in your collaborative
                     work.  If you are not sure whether something counts as plagiarism or
                     academic dishonesty, I can help you if you ask me about it before
                     turning in the assignment.
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>
                     <em>Every</em> instance of academic dishonesty will be reported to the College’s Board on Academic
                     Honesty.
                     The typical penalty for plagiarism on an assignment is a grade of zero in the assignment
                     and a one-third reduction in the total letter grade for the course.
                     Penalties for repeat or egregious offenses can extend to a grade of XE in the course
                     or suspension from the university.
                     Please note that plagiarism on a draft is typically treated as a separate infraction
                     from plagiarism on a final revision of the same paper.
