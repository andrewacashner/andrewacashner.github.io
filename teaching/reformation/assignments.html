                     <p>There will be a short section with nuts-and-bolts type questions 
                        (e.g., technical terms, theological doctrines,
                        names of reformers – all things that have come up repeatedly in class 
                        and been written on the board, nothing super obscure).

                     <p>I will play two excerpts from assigned listening, and I will give you
                        the basic information about the excerpt (e.g., composer, title). Each excerpt will
                        be recognizable from a 
                        distinct Reformation tradition of worship (so I won’t play William Byrd’s secret Catholic
                        Mass or Lutherans
                        singing Latin plainchant).

                     <p>
                        I will ask you to explain what this piece exemplifies about its tradition. In particular,
                        what does it reveal about the relationship between belief and practice in that tradition?

                     <p>I will provide a short quotation from an assigned primary source (that is, a reading
                        written before 1800), and I 
                        will ask you to explain the meaning and put it in context. You don’t necessarily have
                        to be
                        able to identify the exact author, but you should recognize the statement as representing
                        a distinct perspective on worship in the Reformation. (Again, the example won’t be
                        a trick.)

               You will be assigned a group and a hymn text.
               Research the history of this hymn until you can trace it from its 
               earliest known sources through today.
               Find out the author and find the text in its original form and language.
               Identify any earlier sources the text and/or tune may be based on.
               Trace the text and the different tunes connected to it through a variety of hymn books
               from different places and traditions.
               Find pieces of music such as organ preludes, cantatas, motets, anthems, etc., based
               on
               the hymn text and/or tune.

               Give a group presentation in which you 
               
               <ul>
                  
                  <li>
                     outline the history of the hymn;
                     
                  </li>
                  
                  <li>
                     situate the hymn in its confessional background (e.g., connect it to the Reformation
                     church
                     in which it originated), interpreting the theological message and devotional functions
                     of the text;
                     
                  </li>
                  
                  <li>
                     consider the text’s original audience and later audiences and multiple ways it could
                     have been used; and
                     
                  </li>
                  
                  <li>
                     provide a small selection of musical settings or works based on the hymn and analyze
                     how they relate to the hymn, what they add to its interpretation, meaning; how they
                     might change
                     its social/religious functions.

            </p>
            
            <p>
               There is a large assortment of old hymn books on reserve in the Art/Music Library,
               primarily from 1800-1900.
               Use these as your primary sources, in addition to other sources you may be able to
               find.
               On the presentation day we will have these sources in the classroom so you can use
               them in your presentation.
               
            </p>
            
            <p>
               Your presentation must include a handout.
               Actually this will be a PDF that you will submit via Blackboard (by the start of class
               on presentation day) and we will view digitally.
               The handout must include a bibliography of at least three scholarly sources.
               You should also include the most important names and examples you will discuss in
               your presentation.
               
            </p>
            
            <p>
               Every member of the group must be present and participate in the presentation.
               Live singing or playing is highly encouraged but not required.
               You will receive both a group and individual score, which will be combined to result
               in your grade.
               You must make clear in your written submission what each person contributed to the
               project.

            <p>
               Choose one short selection of music from the syllabus. 
               I recommend that you choose an aria from Bach’s <cite>St. Matthew Passion</cite>
               but you have freedom to pursue your own interest.
               Analyze the relationship between musical structure and style on the one hand, 
               and theological beliefs in the tradition relevant to this piece, on the other.
               How does this music contribute to worship as understood in a particular tradition?
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p>
               Write a short paper, 2.5 to 4 pages in length, in which you focus on a 
               few analytical details of the music and connect them to specific and relevant theological
               sources.
               
            </p>
            
            <p>
               You do not need to do a technical music-theory-class type analysis (unless you can,
               in which
               case you probably should exercise your skills!). Base this on what you hear.
               How do the movements and patterns of the music line up with the words?
               Does the music sound like other music (e.g., Palestrina-style counterpoint or operatic
               music)?
               How do the structures of the music fit with other kinds of structures (e.g., ritual
               forms,
               social structures like church governance)?
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p>
               You are welcome to do additional research, especially in primary sources (e.g., sermons
               
               or commentaries of Luther), but you may do the whole paper perfectly well just based
               on material
               already assigned on the syllabus.
               The purpose of the paper is analysis (take apart the thing and see how it works) and
               interpretation (what do you think it means? what do you think the creators meant by
               it?
               what do you think the original hearers thought it meant? what did they <em>do</em> with it spiritually 
               speaking, or what did it enable them to do?).

               Visit a local Christian church for a worship service. 
               Carefully observe and make notes, then write an ethnographic essay of

               with their historical and theological background in one of the Reformation traditions.

               <ul>
                  
                  <li>
                     When does the service start? Is everyone there at the beginning or do people come
                     late or leave early?
                     Can people come and go? Are there multiple activities going on or does everyone do
                     the same thing?
                     
                  </li>
                  
                  <li>
                     What are the demographics and style of the community?
                     How are people dressed? What kind of people are present?
                     Does the group appear to be homogeneous in ethnic background, social class, economic
                     position,
                     education level, etc.?
                     If there is diversity, what kind is there? Is it mentioned or dealt with explicitly
                     in any way?
                     
                  </li>
                  
                  <li>
                     Who calls the service to order, or how does the service start? Do people seem to know
                     what to do already?
                     Does someone explain things or do they just happen? 
                     How are transitions handled? How are guests, visitors, non-members treated? How do
                     members/participants
                     treat each other?
                     Who seems to be in charge? Is it the same person that the bulletin/website says is
                     in charge? 
                     (e.g., is the pastor leading the service or the musicians?)
                     
                  </li>
                  
                  <li>
                     What is the shape and structure of the service? Does it seem planned in advance? 
                     Is there a printed program? Do people use books like a prayer book, book of liturgical
                     readings, hymnal, etc.? Do people bring Bibles with them to church? Rosaries? 
                     Even if there is no explicit plan, can you discern one?

                        a time of praise, worship, glorification, exalted singing or speaking about God, naming
                        the positive attributes of God, thanking God for present and past favors

                        if there is a Eucharistic celebration, does it follow a structured, pre-written text?
                        
                        Who leads it? What physical actions accompany the words that are used? How are the
                        elements
                        (bread and wine) treated? Are there other elements (e.g., water) used?
                        Does the ceremony feel solemn, festive, jubilant, sorrowful, dutiful, perfunctory,
                        confused, a time for coming together or a time for individual reflection, etc.?

                        How is the space organized? Is there an area that is reserved as especially sacred,
                        e.g., where
                        only clergy can go, or objects that only clergy can touch? Are there wires and cables
                        everywhere?
                        Is there a choir? Do they sit in a separate area to themselves? In front or behind?
                        What relationships can you discern between the architectural style and the style of
                        worship
                        and community interaction?

                     <li>When is there music without singing? When, if at all, is there music not connected
                        in any way to words (e.g., based on a hymn tune)? What instruments are used? Where
                        are they?

                     <li>Do people introduce songs verbally or just start singing them? 
                        Do they practice parts of the song (e.g., <q>Let’s try that part again</q>) as they do it?
                        Does everyone seem to know the music?
                        Do people actually sing along? Heartily? Does anyone sing harmony? Do people embellish
                        the melody or sing it straight along with the leader? Does the leader embellish the
                        melody?

                        are 
                        presented in the words and in the music? Do they seem related to each other, to the

                        of the sermon or the festival being celebrated?

                        Are denominational
                        distinctives like predestination, transubstantiation, salvation by grace, etc., explicitly
