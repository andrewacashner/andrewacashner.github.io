                     Basic knowledge:
                     
                     <p>There will be a short section with nuts-and-bolts type questions 
                        (e.g., technical terms, theological doctrines,
                        names of reformers – all things that have come up repeatedly in class 
                        and been written on the board, nothing super obscure).

                     Listening:
                     
                     <p>I will play two excerpts from assigned listening, and I will give you
                        the basic information about the excerpt (e.g., composer, title). Each excerpt will
                        be recognizable from a 
                        distinct Reformation tradition of worship (so I won’t play William Byrd’s secret Catholic
                        Mass or Lutherans
                        singing Latin plainchant).

                     <p>
                        I will ask you to explain what this piece exemplifies about its tradition. In particular,
                        what does it reveal about the relationship between belief and practice in that tradition?

                     Reading:
                     
                     <p>I will provide a short quotation from an assigned primary source (that is, a reading
                        written before 1800), and I 
                        will ask you to explain the meaning and put it in context. You don’t necessarily have
                        to be
                        able to identify the exact author, but you should recognize the statement as representing
                        a distinct perspective on worship in the Reformation. (Again, the example won’t be
                        a trick.)

            <p>
               You will be assigned a group and a hymn text.
               Research the history of this hymn until you can trace it from its 
               earliest known sources through today.
               Find out the author and find the text in its original form and language.
               Identify any earlier sources the text and/or tune may be based on.
               Trace the text and the different tunes connected to it through a variety of hymn books
               from different places and traditions.
               Find pieces of music such as organ preludes, cantatas, motets, anthems, etc., based
               on
               the hymn text and/or tune.

               Give a group presentation in which you 
               
               <ul>
                  
                  <li>
                     outline the history of the hymn;
                     
                  </li>
                  
                  <li>
                     situate the hymn in its confessional background (e.g., connect it to the Reformation
                     church
                     in which it originated), interpreting the theological message and devotional functions
                     of the text;
                     
                  </li>
                  
                  <li>
                     consider the text’s original audience and later audiences and multiple ways it could
                     have been used; and
                     
                  </li>
                  
                  <li>
                     provide a small selection of musical settings or works based on the hymn and analyze
                     how they relate to the hymn, what they add to its interpretation, meaning; how they
                     might change
                     its social/religious functions.
                     
                  </li>

            </p>
            
            <p>
               There is a large assortment of old hymn books on reserve in the Art/Music Library,
               primarily from 1800-1900.
               Use these as your primary sources, in addition to other sources you may be able to
               find.
               On the presentation day we will have these sources in the classroom so you can use
               them in your presentation.
               
            </p>
            
            <p>
               Your presentation must include a handout.
               Actually this will be a PDF that you will submit via Blackboard (by the start of class
               on presentation day) and we will view digitally.
               The handout must include a bibliography of at least three scholarly sources.
               You should also include the most important names and examples you will discuss in
               your presentation.
               
            </p>
            
            <p>
               Every member of the group must be present and participate in the presentation.
               Live singing or playing is highly encouraged but not required.
               You will receive both a group and individual score, which will be combined to result
               in your grade.
               You must make clear in your written submission what each person contributed to the
               project.
