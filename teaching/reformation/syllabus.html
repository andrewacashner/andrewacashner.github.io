            <p>
               This course equips students to understand the key role of music in shaping the new
               identities and beliefs of the Christian communities that emerged from the Reformations
               of the sixteenth century: Lutherans, Calvinists, Anglicans, and Roman Catholics, including
               colonial societies around the globe. 
               We will study the link between faith, music, and community in Lutheran chorales and
               Puritan psalms, Palestrina’s masses and J. S. Bach’s Passions, and music from colonial
               Latin America. 
               In light of theological literature of the time we will study how music served as a
               form of ritual and prayer for communities and individuals. 
               This historical knowledge will enable students to understand the roots of living traditions
               of Christian worship today. 
               No musical or theological background required.

               This course equips students to achieve the following learning goals:
               
               <ol>
                  
                  <li>
                     Demonstrate understanding of the different theologies and practices of worship 
                     in the four major traditions of Christianity that emerged from the Reformation: 
                     Lutheran, Calvinist/Reformed, Anglican, and Roman Catholic:

                        <li>
                           Understand how those beliefs intersect with the core beliefs that distinguish
                           each tradition from the others; and what beliefs were held in common 
                           across confessional boundaries.

                        <li>
                           Understand and think critically about the relationship between
                           belief and practice in these traditions, on the basis of specific examples such 
                           as hymns and choral music.

                  </li>
                  
                  <li>
                     Develop a critical theoretical perspective and knowledge base that will
                     enable you to appreciate and engage with diverse beliefs and practices.

               The focus of the course is historical knowledge and cross-cultural understanding.
               It is <em>not</em> a goal of this course to persuade you to agree with any 
               theological beliefs or follow any ritual practices.
               This course will take a neutral position regarding the truth-claims 
               of all religious traditions.

               To fulfill the university’s accreditation requirements for credit hours,
               there is additional work outside of the classroom included in the planned
               workload for this course.
               Most of the time this additional work constitutes a larger amount of reading
               than might otherwise be assigned; other times it may include group work
               or library research.

                  easily.  You may contact me through my e-mail (listed at the beginning of
                  the syllabus), and I will respond as soon as I can during normal business
                  hours.  Be advised that I may not be able to respond to e-mails on

                  Official <strong>office hours</strong> are listed at the beginning of the

                  someone else is already there, just knock or say hello so I know you are
                  waiting and I’ll make sure there is time for you.  I am also available by
                  appointment: e-mail me or ask me after class and we’ll find a time.  I am
                  here to help you and I want the opportunity to get to know you!

               <p>
                  I will take attendance at every class.
                  You will learn best if you come to 
                  every class and get involved as fully as you can in whatever we are doing 
                  in the classroom.
                  That involvement starts before you come to class as you prepare each class
                  session’s listening and reading assignments, as you write in your
                  listening journal, and as you do your other coursework alone and with your
                  classmates.
                  
               </p>
               
               <p>
                  You can find the detailed listings, including links to online texts and music,
                  by clicking on the heading for each class session on the schedule page.
                  You are expected listen to and read all of the assigned material 
                  <em>before</em> you come to class that day.

               <p>
                  The materials for this course will all be available online through 
                  this site and Blackboard,
                  so you will need to have a way to access this material in class.
                  Phones can work, but a larger screen will be useful.
                  It is certainly possible to look on with classmates.
                  In-class group work will also require internet access for research.
                  If the use of electronic devices in class presents a hardship for you, please
                  let me know and we can find a solution.
                  
               </p>
               
               
               <p>
                  Since we will be using devices in class, you must find a way to keep focus by eliminating
                  distractions on the devices (e.g., turning off notifications).
                  We all must make every effort, with devices or not, to connect with each other as
                  human
                  beings, making eye contact, listening actively, and being mentally present to each
                  other.

                  Please turn in assignments through the electronic submission portal on Blackboard.
                  Submit PDF files only.
                  I will not accept assignments via e-mail, hard copy, or in any format other than PDF.
                  
               </p>
               
               <p>
                  Use a basic 12-point font, double spaced, with one-inch margins on all sides.  
                  Be sure to include your name and the name and date of the assignment.

               <p>
                  Assignments are due on the date listed in the syllabus.  Assignments
                  turned in after that time will be considered late (Blackboard tracks this automatically),
                  
                  and a penalty will be deducted from the grade (minus one letter grade for each day
                  late).  
                  Unless you arrange an extension with me in
                  advance, which I must confirm in writing, I will not accept assignments
                  more than four days after the original due date.

               <p>
                  I will only arrange makeups for exams in exceptional
                  circumstances such as a documented health or family emergency.

                  that goal.  I and my colleages in the Department of Music are fully
                  committed to preventing any kind of harassment or discrimination.  The

                        The University of Rochester seeks to provide a setting that respects
                        the contributions of all the individuals composing its community, that
                        encourages intellectual and personal development, and that promotes
                        the free exchange of ideas.

                        To ensure nondiscrimination and equal opportunity, the University
                        prohibits and will not engage in discrimination or harassment on the
                        basis of age, color, disability, ethnicity, gender identity or
                        expression, genetic information, marital status, military/veteran
                        status, national origin, race, religion/creed, sex, sexual
                        orientation, or any other status protected by law. The University also
                        prohibits retaliation and will not retaliate against any person who
                        makes a complaint of discrimination or harassment on the basis on a
                        protected status or who provides information or otherwise participates
                        in a investigation of such a complaint.

                        If you believe you have been discriminated against or harassed due to
                        your protected status, you have several options for how to respond.

                     false, or misleading citations; or unacknowledged help from others
