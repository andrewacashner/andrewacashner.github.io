<h1 id="controversies-between-jews-christians-and-gentiles">Controversies between Jews, Christians, and Gentiles</h1>
<ul>
<li>continuity and discontinuity</li>
<li>Mizrahi Jewish (Iraqi) chanting of <em>Shema</em> (Deuteronomy 6:4–5)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="hebrew-origins">Hebrew origins</h2>
<ul>
<li>Formative crises:
<ul>
<li>Exodus (Passover, deliverance from slavery in Egypt, brought through wilderness into the Promised Land – Palestine/Israel)</li>
<li>Exile (taken by force into Babylon)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Covenant - two-way promise
<ul>
<li><em>hesed</em> (steadfast love, covenant love), “O Love That Wilt Not Let Me Go”</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Images of ancient worship - tabernacle in wilderness, temple under Solomon</p></li>
<li>theology of worship in Hebrew Scriptures:
<ul>
<li>God is One, God is creator, humans are made in God’s image</li>
<li>Humans broke or fell away from relationship with God</li>
<li>God worked through individuals to save a particular family (Abraham -&gt; Hebrew people), through whom he would save the world</li>
<li>God established law – sacrifices of animals to cleanse from sin</li>
<li>People broke their part of the covenant, and God judged them and punished with exile (<strong>Prophetic tradition</strong>, critiquing false worship, insincere worship, idolatrous worship)
<ul>
<li>Amos 5:21–24</li>
</ul></li>
<li>God also promised a longer-term salvation</li>
</ul></li>
<li>patterns of prayer/worship
<ul>
<li>In worship: praising, blessing (saying what in good about God, remembering his mighty acts on their behalf) – Psalm 66:3, “Say to God, ‘How awesome are your deeds!’”</li>
<li><p>Supplication (asking for God to be faithful to his promise in a particular contemporary situation)</p></li>
<li><p><em>Berakah</em> form of prayer (“Blessed are you, O Lord…”)</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="jesus-and-early-christian-worship-in-lukeacts">Jesus and early Christian worship in Luke/Acts</h1>
<ul>
<li>Messiah (Hebrew) / <em>Christos</em> (Greek) – “Anointed One”
<ul>
<li>blessing with oil
<ul>
<li>marker of royalty</li>
</ul></li>
<li>heir to the throne of David, Savior of Israel, a restorer of the kingdom, fulfiller of the covenant</li>
<li>“Son of Man” (Daniel)</li>
<li>Military hero?
<ul>
<li>not what they expected</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>gospels as account of a community in crisis, figuring out its identity, esp. w/r/t Judaism</p></li>
<li><p>Luke 1, examples of <em>berakah</em> type prayer from Mary and Zechariah remembering covenant, celebrating its fulfillment – emphasis on <em>eleos</em> (= <em>hesed</em>, steadfast love)</p></li>
<li>examples of Jesus not being what people expected
<ul>
<li>debate over whether he is Messiah, e.g. on the cross</li>
<li>unconventional approach to people, open to outsiders, “sinners,” “unclean”</li>
<li><p>“good news preached to the poor” (Isaiah)</p></li>
<li>crucifixion - executed as a criminal, challenge to concept of Messiah as restorer of political kingdom
<ul>
<li>Christ to Pilate in John, “My kingdom is not of this world”</li>
</ul></li>
<li>resurrection - (to Christian believers) proof of Jesus’s divinity, proof of his truthfulness
<ul>
<li>But the early disciples were confused, didn’t know what to make of it</li>
<li>Example of the Supper at Emmaus (Luke 24) where Christ is “made known to them in the breaking of the bread” after explaining to them how to understand the Hebrew Scriptures as pointing to the Messiah suffering, dying, and rising again.
<ul>
<li>Document of early church’s worship (Scripture, preaching, and sharing in Christ’s presence through the breaking of bread)</li>
<li>But also document of disciples’ initial confusion, crisis, as throughout the gospels, especially Mark and John, emphasizing that the disciples did not understand who Jesus was or what kind of Messiah he was going to be</li>
