<h1 id="sources-of-early-christian-worship">Sources of early Christian worship</h1>
<ul>
<li>From Jesus to early Christianity</li>
<li>Jews to Jewish Christians to Gentile Christians</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="corinthians-elements-and-theology-of-worship">1 Corinthians: Elements and theology of worship</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Glimpse of a community in crisis, in transition</p></li>
<li>Eucharist - bread and wine as body and blood of Christ</li>
<li>community meal - <em>agapes</em> (“love feasts”)
<ul>
<li>one body (1 Cor 12:12-13)</li>
<li>presence of risen Christ</li>
<li><p>remembering the death of Christ</p></li>
<li><p>debate over meat sacrificed to idols</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>traditio</em> - what is passed on (1 Cor 11:23)</li>
<li><p>Last Supper</p></li>
<li>emphasis on love: highest of spiritual gifts, summit of all Christian life</li>
<li>universal salvation – not just for the Jews
<ul>
<li>“Jews and Greeks” both</li>
</ul></li>
<li>baptism - ritual/ceremonial washing
<ul>
<li>death and rebirth</li>
<li>cleansing from sin</li>
<li>entrance into community/family</li>
<li>“rites of Christian initiation” (plus anointing with oil)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>spiritual gifts - prophecy, teaching, knowledge, “tongues”</li>
<li><p>glimpses of heaven</p></li>
<li>Paul: but if you don’t have love it doesn’t matter
<ul>
<li>cf. Jesus in John: “love one another as I have loved you”</li>
<li>cf. prophetic tradition of critiquing worship that is not accompanied by justice, as in Amos</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="didache-vs.-birkat-ha-mazon"><em>Didache</em> vs. <em>Birkat ha-mazon</em></h2>
<ul>
<li>some obvious similarities, though the relationship is complex and hard to be certain of</li>
<li>Didache dates from possibly 50-75 AD; Birkat hamazon is an old tradition but the earliest written source is from several centuries later</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="basic-patterns-of-worship-c.-2nd-century">Basic patterns of worship c. 2nd century</h1>
<ul>
<li>is not a single pattern of worship - there are many changing local traditions
<ul>
<li>example, at the beginning of the year (around winter solstice), themes of worship may have depended on which gospel a community had
<ul>
<li>e.g., Matthew starts with birth of Jesus and visitation of three kings, like the feast of Epiphany; while Mark starts with Jesus’s baptism and ministry and doesn’t include his birth, like the feast of Christ’s baptism in the same time of year</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>coalesce later into smaller number of traditions</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="practices-and-concepts-of-music-in-the-earliest-stages">Practices and concepts of music in the earliest stages</h1>
<h2 id="kyrie-eleison">Kyrie eleison</h2>
<ul>
<li>One song whose words go all the way back: the Kyrie at opening of worship</li>
<li>Kyrie eleison - Lord have mercy, Christ have mercy, Lord have mercy</li>
<li>In Greek language, kept in Greek even after Roman Christians switched to Latin in 3rd-4th centuries – why?
<ul>
<li>possibly because they already knew it to certain tunes (like Christmas carols today that use thees and thous)</li>
<li>more likely (or in addition), because these were loaded words for Greek-speaking Christians, connecting back to the specific personal name of God in the Old Testament and his “steadfast love” or covenant love</li>
<li><em>Kyrios</em> - same word used in the Greek translation of Old Testament (Septuagint) for divine name (YHWH)</li>
<li><em>eleos</em> (mercy) - used in Septuagint for <em>hesed</em> - steadfast love, covenant love</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
